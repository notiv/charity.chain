It can kill within hours if left\nuntreated, but most patients recover if treated promptly with oral rehydration\nsalts.\n\nThe latest figures represent a 3.3 percent fatality rate - well above the 1\npercent rate that the World Health Organization rates as an emergency. The\nshort incubation period of two hours to five days means the disease can spread\nwith explosive speed.\n\nMore than 20,000 people have been killed in the conflict with Boko Haram, at\nleast 2.2 million have been displaced, and 5.2 million in the northeast are\nshort of food, with tens of thousands living in famine-like conditions, U.N.\nfigures show.

Das and Antoni Slodkowski\n\nCOX'S BAZAR, Bangladesh/YANGON, Sept 9 (Reuters) - The Red Cross organizations\nare scaling up operations in Myanmar's violence-riven northwest, after the\nUnited Nations had to suspend activities there following government\nsuggestions that its agency had supported Rohingya insurgents.\n\nWhile the world has focused on Bangladesh, where some 290,000 Rohingya have\nfled an army crackdown on the militants in two weeks, a serious humanitarian\ncrisis is also unfolding on the Myanmar side, aid workers say.\n\nThousands of displaced people have been stranded or left without food for\nweeks.\n\nThe flight of the Rohingya began on Aug. 25 after Rohingya insurgents attacked\npolice posts and an army base in Rakhine state. That triggered an army\ncounter-offensive in which at least 400 people were killed, thousands of\nhouses were burned, villages razed and vast swathes of land depopulated.\n\n\"The U.N. and INGOs have not been very welcome in Rakhine and...they are not\nable to operate and ensure the safety and security of their staff and\nvolunteers,\" said Joy Singhal of the International Federation of Red Cross and\nRed Crescent Societies (IFRC).\n\n\"In such an environment, the government has invited the Red Cross to assist\nthem,\" Singhal said.\n\nAid workers worry many Rohingya had been left without food since mid-July,\nwhen the World Food Programme (WFP), which had been providing food and cash\nassistance, was unable to operate.\n\nThe U.N. evacuated \"non-critical\" staff from the area after the government\nsuggested the WFP and international aid groups supported the insurgents\nshortly after the attacks.\n\nJoy said the government would have the role of \"coordination and\nfacilitation,\" but the \"assessment, aid delivery and implementation\" would all\nbe managed by the Red Cross.\n\nThousands of people are still trying to cross mountains, dense bush and rice\nfields to reach Bangladesh.\n\nThe government said it would establish camps for internally displaced people,\nbut the move could spark opposition from some humanitarian experts.\n\nThe U.N. objected to the creation of \"camp-like\" villages for the Rohingya in\nApril, citing the risk of stoking tensions. The U.N. stressed the importance\nof allowing displaced people to return to their place of origin and\nlivelihoods.\n\nCRISIS IN BANGLADESH\n\nOn Friday, the U.N. in Bangladesh found tens of thousands of refugees who had\nnot been counted before, raising the count dramatically to 270,000 from some\n164,000 the day before. On Saturday, that jumped by another 20,000 as the\nstream of hungry, traumatised and destitute people showed no signs of abating.\n\nThe wave of refugees has strained aid agencies already helping hundreds of\nthousands displaced by previous waves of violence in Myanmar.\n\nAustralia will provide up to $4.03 million in assistance, Foreign Minister\nJulie Bishop said on Saturday, adding the aid will be distributed in\nBangladesh through WFP and the International Organisation for Migration.\n\nOn Saturday, thousands of Rohingya were milling on the road near the camp of\nKutapalong, carrying bamboo and black tarpaulin to build shacks. Children and\nwomen flocked to every stopping vehicle, extending their arms, begging.\n\nBuddhist-majority Myanmar says its forces are fighting a legitimate campaign\nagainst \"terrorists\" it blames for the attacks on them and for burning homes\nand civilian deaths. It says about 30,000 non-Muslims have been displaced.\n\nLANDMINES\n\nAmnesty International said it had confirmed that Myanmar military used\nlandmines near the border with Bangladesh after Reuters first reported\nexplosions and what Bangladeshi border guards said were injuries caused by\nanti-personnel mines.\n\nThe organization said the mines \"have seriously injured at least three\ncivilians, including two children, and reportedly killed one man in the past\nweek,\" citing eyewitnesses and analysis by its weapons experts.\n\n\"Authorities must immediately end this abhorrent practice against people who\nare already fleeing persecution,\" said Tirana Hassan, Amnesty International's\ncrisis response director.\n\nBangladesh lodged a protest on Wednesday after it also said Myanmar had laid\nmines near the border.\n\nA Myanmar military source told Reuters mines were laid along the border in the\n1990s to prevent trespassing and the military had since tried to remove them.\nBut none had been planted recently.\n\nThe army has not commented on the blasts.\n\nZaw Htay, the spokesman for Myanmar's national leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, told\nReuters on Monday that a clarification was needed to determine \"where did it\nexplode, who can go there and who laid those land mines. Who can surely say\nthose mines were not laid by the terrorists?\" (Additional reporting by Ben\nCooper in Sydney; Editing by Kim Coghill)\n\n","cause":"children"}

Das\n\nDHAKA (Reuters) - Bangladesh has proposed creating \"safe zones\" run by aid\ngroups for Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar's Rakhine state to stop hundreds of\nthousands of refugees crossing into its territory following a military\ncrackdown.\n\nThe plan, the latest in a string of ideas floated by Dhaka, is unlikely to get\nmuch traction in Myanmar, where many consider the Rohingya community of 1.1\nmillion as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. That will leave Bangladesh, one\nof the poorest nations in the world, with little choice but to open new camps\nfor refugees.\n\nDhaka sent the proposal to the Myanmar government through the International\nCommittee of the Red Cross to secure three areas in Rakhine, home to the\nRohingya community, suggesting that people displaced by the violence be\nrelocated there under the supervision of an international organization, such\nas the United Nations.\n\n\"The logic of the creation of such zones is that no Rohingya can come inside\nBangladesh,\" said Shahidul Haque, Bangladesh's foreign secretary, the top\ncivil servant in the foreign ministry.\n\nThe Red Cross confirmed that it had passed on the request to Myanmar but said\nthat it was a political decision for the two countries to make.\n\nA Myanmar government spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nHundreds of thousands of Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh, a mostly Muslim\nnation of 160 million, from Buddhist-majority Myanmar in recent years.\n\nThe decades-old conflict in Rakhine flared most recently on Aug. 25, when\nRohingya insurgents attacked several police posts and an army base. Since\nthen, an estimated 270,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh, according to the\nU.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, joining more than 400,000 others already\nliving there in cramped makeshift camps since the early 1990s.\n\nThere are widespread fears that tens of thousands more could try to cross if\nthe violence doesn't abate. Recent pictures from the border between the two\ncountries show hundreds of Rohingya men, women and children trying to cross\nover into Bangladesh on foot and by boat.\n\nThe humanitarian crisis next door has left Bangladesh scrambling to deal with\npeople that it does not welcome either.\n\nIn recent days, Bangladesh officials have said they plan to go ahead with a\ncontroversial plan to develop an isolated, flood-prone island in the Bay of\nBengal to temporarily house tens of thousands of refugees, drawing fresh\ncriticism from the international community.\n\n\"TEMPORARY SHELTER\"\n\nIt bowed to pressure on Thursday, with government officials saying that Dhaka\nwould now make another 1,500 acres (607 hectares) of land available for camps\nto house refugees near Cox's Bazar, where many refugees already live as it is\nnear the border with Myanmar.\n\n\"They will be given temporary shelter,\" said Kazi Abdur Rahman, additional\ndeputy commissioner of Cox's Bazar. But Rahman added that the refugees would\nbe fingerprinted and confined to the camp so that they did not mix with the\nlocal community.\n\nThese measures, however, do not offer a long-term solution to the crisis, and\nDhaka says it is getting little support from its neighbor, which has been\naccused of trying to engineer ethnic cleansing within its borders.\n\nBangladesh officials said they had proposed joint patrolling along the border\nbut did not receive a response from Myanmar. Earlier this week, Bangladesh\nlodged a protest after it said Myanmar had laid landmines near the border\nbetween the two countries.\n\nMyanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel Laureate, has come under pressure to\nhalt violence against Rohingya. She has said that her government was doing its\nbest to protect everyone in Rakhine but did not refer specifically to the\nRohingya exodus.\n\n\"The solution lies in Myanmar. The UN hopes that Myanmar can address the root\ncauses of the problem,\" said Shinji Kubo, head of the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Refugees in Bangladesh.\n\nKubo said the Bangladesh government was doing its best by accepting the\nrefugees instead of sending them back.\n\nBangladesh officials are turning to the international community for help,\nclaiming support from countries such as Turkey, which has promised aid.\n\nOn Friday, a Malaysian coast guard official said the country will not turn\naway Rohingya Muslims and is willing to provide them temporary shelter. But\nany such voyage would be hazardous for the next few months, because of the\nannual monsoon.\n\n\"The world community must come forward to help them, not by putting pressure\non Bangladesh but by putting pressure on Myanmar not to resort to these\natrocities and violence,\" said H.T. Imam, a senior aide to Bangladesh Prime\nMinister Sheikh Hasina.\n\n\"The only solution is to force Myanmar to take back their citizens through\ninternational pressure. And we are working with our partners on that,\" Imam\nsaid.\n\nBesides the creation of internationally-controlled safe zones in Rakhine\nstate, Bangladesh has also mooted creating a buffer zone along the border,\nwhere the international community could set up camps and provide for the\nrefugees, the officials said.\n\nFurther details of the plan could not be learned.\n\n\"We will give aid agencies access. But we are not interested to give them\nshelter here. We are already overburdened,\" said Mostafa Kamal Uddin,\nBangladesh's home secretary.\n\n(Additional reporting by Antoni Slodkowski in Yangon; Writing by Paritosh\nBansal)\n\n","cause":"children"}
