It can kill within hours if left\nuntreated, but most patients recover if treated promptly with oral rehydration\nsalts.\n\nThe latest figures represent a 3.3 percent fatality rate - well above the 1\npercent rate that the World Health Organization rates as an emergency. The\nshort incubation period of two hours to five days means the disease can spread\nwith explosive speed.\n\nMore than 20,000 people have been killed in the conflict with Boko Haram, at\nleast 2.2 million have been displaced, and 5.2 million in the northeast are\nshort of food, with tens of thousands living in famine-like conditions, U.N.\nfigures show.

That triggered an army\ncounter-offensive in which at least 400 people were killed, thousands of\nhouses were burned, villages razed and vast swathes of land depopulated.\n\n\"The U.N. and INGOs have not been very welcome in Rakhine and...they are not\nable to operate and ensure the safety and security of their staff and\nvolunteers,\" said Joy Singhal of the International Federation of Red Cross and\nRed Crescent Societies (IFRC).\n\n\"In such an environment, the government has invited the Red Cross to assist\nthem,\" Singhal said.\n\nAid workers worry many Rohingya had been left without food since mid-July,\nwhen the World Food Programme (WFP), which had been providing food and cash\nassistance, was unable to operate.\n\nThe U.N. evacuated \"non-critical\" staff from the area after the government\nsuggested the WFP and international aid groups supported the insurgents\nshortly after the attacks.\n\nJoy said the government would have the role of \"coordination and\nfacilitation,\" but the \"assessment, aid delivery and implementation\" would all\nbe managed by the Red Cross.\n\nThousands of people are still trying to cross mountains, dense bush and rice\nfields to reach Bangladesh.\n\nThe government said it would establish camps for internally displaced people,\nbut the move could spark opposition from some humanitarian experts.\n\nThe U.N. objected to the creation of \"camp-like\" villages for the Rohingya in\nApril, citing the risk of stoking tensions. The U.N. stressed the importance\nof allowing displaced people to return to their place of origin and\nlivelihoods.\n\nCRISIS IN BANGLADESH\n\nOn Friday, the U.N. in Bangladesh found tens of thousands of refugees who had\nnot been counted before, raising the count dramatically to 270,000 from some\n164,000 the day before. On Saturday, that jumped by another 20,000 as the\nstream of hungry, traumatised and destitute people showed no signs of abating.\n\nThe wave of refugees has strained aid agencies already helping hundreds of\nthousands displaced by previous waves of violence in Myanmar.\n\nAustralia will provide up to $4.03 million in assistance, Foreign Minister\nJulie Bishop said on Saturday, adding the aid will be distributed in\nBangladesh through WFP and the International Organisation for Migration.\n\nOn Saturday, thousands of Rohingya were milling on the road near the camp of\nKutapalong, carrying bamboo and black tarpaulin to build shacks. Children and\nwomen flocked to every stopping vehicle, extending their arms, begging.\n\nBuddhist-majority Myanmar says its forces are fighting a legitimate campaign\nagainst \"terrorists\" it blames for the attacks on them and for burning homes\nand civilian deaths. It says about 30,000 non-Muslims have been displaced.\n\nLANDMINES\n\nAmnesty International said it had confirmed that Myanmar military used\nlandmines near the border with Bangladesh after Reuters first reported\nexplosions and what Bangladeshi border guards said were injuries caused by\nanti-personnel mines.\n\nThe organization said the mines \"have seriously injured at least three\ncivilians, including two children, and reportedly killed one man in the past\nweek,\" citing eyewitnesses and analysis by its weapons experts.\n\n\"Authorities must immediately end this abhorrent practice against people who\nare already fleeing persecution,\" said Tirana Hassan, Amnesty International's\ncrisis response director.\n\nBangladesh lodged a protest on Wednesday after it also said Myanmar had laid\nmines near the border.\n\nA Myanmar military source told Reuters mines were laid along the border in the\n1990s to prevent trespassing and the military had since tried to remove them.\nBut none had been planted recently.\n\nThe army has not commented on the blasts.\n\nZaw Htay, the spokesman for Myanmar's national leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, told\nReuters on Monday that a clarification was needed to determine \"where did it\nexplode, who can go there and who laid those land mines. Who can surely say\nthose mines were not laid by the terrorists?\" (Additional reporting by Ben\nCooper in Sydney; Editing by Kim Coghill)\n\n","dateCreated":{"$date":"2017-09-09T10:04:57.000Z"},"charityOrg":"Red Cross","headline":"Red Cross fills UN void in Myanmar's violence-torn region","guid":"tag:reuters.com,2017:newsml_L4N1LQ07Q","cause":"children","geography":"PH"}

Security\nCouncil censure over the violence that has forced an exodus of nearly 150,000\nRohingya Muslims to Bangladesh in less than two weeks.\n\nMyanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi blamed \"terrorists\" for \"a huge iceberg of\nmisinformation\" on the strife in the northwestern state of Rakhine but, in a\nstatement, she made no mention of the Rohingya who have fled.\n\nSuu Kyi has come under increasing pressure from countries with Muslim\npopulations, including Indonesia, where thousands led by Islamist groups\nrallied in Jakarta on Wednesday to demand that diplomatic ties with Buddhist-\nmajority Myanmar be cut.\n\nIn a rare letter to the U.N. Security Council, Secretary-General Antonio\nGuterres expressed concern the violence could spiral into a \"humanitarian\ncatastrophe\".\n\nHe warned on Tuesday that there was a risk of ethnic cleansing in Myanmar that\ncould destabilize the region.\n\nMyanmar National Security Adviser Thaung Tun said Myanmar was counting on\nChina and Russia, both permanent members of the Security Council, to block a\nU.N. resolution on the crisis.\n\n\"We are negotiating with some friendly countries not to take it to the\nSecurity Council,\" he told a news conference. \"China is our friend and we have\na similar friendly relationship with Russia, so it will not be possible for\nthat issue to go forward.\"\n\nRussia's U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said he believed the 15-member\nSecurity Council had sent a signal, by meeting behind closed doors on the\nissue a week ago, that it would like to see the situation calm down.\n\n\"We called for restraint,\" he told reporters on Tuesday. \"The Security Council\nfor the time being did what it could do.\"\n\nThe U.S. State Department said Washington was \"deeply concerned by sustained\nreports of significant violence and the impact on civilian populations,\nincluding the Rohingya community.\n\n\"These reports include allegations of violence conducted by security forces\nand civilians, as well as additional attacks by ARSA,\" a spokesman said,\nreferring to Arakan Rohingya Solidarity Organization insurgents.\n\nThe spokesman said the United States had discussed the issue with Myanmar \"at\nthe highest levels\" and was also in touch with its neighbors and other\ninternational partners.\n\n\"We welcome indications that the government is committed to providing access\nto humanitarian aid via the Red Cross, and we look forward to learning further\ndetails.\" he added.\n\nReuters reporters in Bangladesh's Cox's Bazar region have witnessed boatloads\nof exhausted Rohingya arriving near the border village of Shamlapur.\n\nAccording to the latest estimates from U.N. workers operating there, arrivals\nin 12 days stood at 146,000. This brought to 233,000 the total number of\nRohingya who have sought refuge in Bangladesh since last October.\n\nNew arrivals told authorities that three boats carrying a total of more than\n100 people capsized in early on Wednesday. Coastguard Commander M.S. Kabir\nsaid six bodies, including three children, had washed ashore.\n\n'FAKE INFORMATION'\n\nThe surge of refugees, many sick or wounded, has strained the resources of aid\nagencies and communities helping hundreds of thousands from previous violence\nin Myanmar. Many have no shelter, and aid agencies are racing to provide\nwater, sanitation and food.\n\n\"People have come with virtually nothing so there has to be food,\" a U.N.\nsource working there said. \"So this is now a huge concern – where is this food\ncoming from for at least the elderly, the children, the women who have come\nover without their husbands?\"\n\nSuu Kyi spoke by telephone on Tuesday with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan,\nwho has pressed world leaders to do more to help a population of roughly 1.1\nmillion he says are facing genocide.\n\nIn a statement issued by her office on Facebook, Suu Kyi said the government\nhad \"already started defending all the people in Rakhine in the best way\npossible\" and warned against misinformation that could mar relations with\nother countries.\n\nShe referred to images on Twitter of killings posted by Turkey's deputy prime\nminister that he later deleted because they were not from Myanmar.\n\n\"She said that kind of fake information which was inflicted on the deputy\nprime minister was simply the tip of a huge iceberg of misinformation\ncalculated to create a lot of problems between different countries and with\nthe aim of promoting the interests of the terrorists,\" her office said in the\nstatement.\n\nSuu Kyi on Wednesday met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who said he\nshared Myanmar's concern about \"extremist violence\" in Rakhine state. Modi's\ngovernment has taken a strong stance on an influx into India of some 40,000\nRohingya from Myanmar over the years, vowing last month to deport them all.\n\nLANDMINES\n\nThe latest violence began when Rohingya insurgents attacked dozens of police\nposts and an army base. The ensuing clashes and a military counter-offensive\nkilled at least 400 people and triggered the exodus of villagers to\nBangladesh.\n\nSuu Kyi has been accused by Western critics of not speaking out for the\nminority that has long complained of persecution, and some have called for the\nNobel Peace Prize she won in 1991 as a champion of democracy to be revoked.\n\nMyanmar says its security forces are fighting a legitimate campaign against\n\"terrorists\" it blames for a string of attacks on police posts and for burning\nhomes and civilian deaths.

Security\nCouncil censure over the violence that has forced an exodus of nearly 150,000\nRohingya Muslims to Bangladesh in less than two weeks.\n\nMyanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi blamed \"terrorists\" for \"a huge iceberg of\nmisinformation\" on the strife in the northwestern state of Rakhine but, in a\nstatement, she made no mention of the Rohingya who have fled.\n\nSuu Kyi has come under increasing pressure from countries with Muslim\npopulations, including Indonesia, where thousands led by Islamist groups\nrallied in Jakarta on Wednesday to demand that diplomatic ties with Buddhist-\nmajority Myanmar be cut.\n\nIn a rare letter to the U.N. Security Council, Secretary-General Antonio\nGuterres expressed concern the violence could spiral into a \"humanitarian\ncatastrophe\".\n\nHe warned on Tuesday that there was a risk of ethnic cleansing in Myanmar that\ncould destabilise the region.\n\nMyanmar National Security Adviser Thaung Tun said Myanmar was counting on\nChina and Russia, both permanent members of the Security Council, to block a\nU.N. resolution on the crisis.\n\n\"We are negotiating with some friendly countries not to take it to the\nSecurity Council,\" he told a news conference. \"China is our friend and we have\na similar friendly relationship with Russia, so it will not be possible for\nthat issue to go forward.\"\n\nRussia's U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said he believed the 15-member\nSecurity Council had sent a signal, by meeting behind closed doors on the\nissue a week ago, that it would like to see the situation calm down.\n\n\"We called for restraint,\" he told reporters on Tuesday. \"The Security Council\nfor the time being did what it could do.\"\n\nThe U.S. State Department said Washington was \"deeply concerned by sustained\nreports of significant violence and the impact on civilian populations,\nincluding the Rohingya community.\n\n\"These reports include allegations of violence conducted by security forces\nand civilians, as well as additional attacks by ARSA,\" a spokesman said,\nreferring to Arakan Rohingya Solidarity Organization insurgents.\n\nThe spokesman said the United States had discussed the issue with Myanmar \"at\nthe highest levels\" and was also in touch with its neighbors and other\ninternational partners.\n\n\"We welcome indications that the government is committed to providing access\nto humanitarian aid via the Red Cross, and we look forward to learning further\ndetails.\" he added.\n\nReuters reporters in Bangladesh's Cox's Bazar region have witnessed boatloads\nof exhausted Rohingya arriving near the border village of Shamlapur.\n\nAccording to the latest estimates from U.N. workers operating there, arrivals\nin 12 days stood at 146,000. This brought to 233,000 the total number of\nRohingya who have sought refuge in Bangladesh since last October.\n\nNew arrivals told authorities that three boats carrying a total of more than\n100 people capsized in early on Wednesday. Coastguard Commander M.S. Kabir\nsaid six bodies, including three children, had washed ashore.\n\n'FAKE INFORMATION'\n\nThe surge of refugees, many sick or wounded, has strained the resources of aid\nagencies and communities helping hundreds of thousands from previous violence\nin Myanmar. Many have no shelter, and aid agencies are racing to provide\nwater, sanitation and food.\n\n\"People have come with virtually nothing so there has to be food,\" a U.N.\nsource working there said. \"So this is now a huge concern – where is this food\ncoming from for at least the elderly, the children, the women who have come\nover without their husbands?\"\n\nSuu Kyi spoke by telephone on Tuesday with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan,\nwho has pressed world leaders to do more to help a population of roughly 1.1\nmillion he says are facing genocide.\n\nIn a statement issued by her office on Facebook, Suu Kyi said the government\nhad \"already started defending all the people in Rakhine in the best way\npossible\" and warned against misinformation that could mar relations with\nother countries.\n\nShe referred to images on Twitter of killings posted by Turkey's deputy prime\nminister that he later deleted because they were not from Myanmar.\n\n\"She said that kind of fake information which was inflicted on the deputy\nprime minister was simply the tip of a huge iceberg of misinformation\ncalculated to create a lot of problems between different countries and with\nthe aim of promoting the interests of the terrorists,\" her office said in the\nstatement.\n\nSuu Kyi on Wednesday met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who said he\nshared Myanmar's concern about \"extremist violence\" in Rakhine state. Modi's\ngovernment has taken a strong stance on an influx into India of some 40,000\nRohingya from Myanmar over the years, vowing last month to deport them all.\n\nLANDMINES\n\nThe latest violence began when Rohingya insurgents attacked dozens of police\nposts and an army base. The ensuing clashes and a military counter-offensive\nkilled at least 400 people and triggered the exodus of villagers to\nBangladesh.\n\nSuu Kyi has been accused by Western critics of not speaking out for the\nminority that has long complained of persecution, and some have called for the\nNobel Peace Prize she won in 1991 as a champion of democracy to be revoked.\n\nMyanmar says its security forces are fighting a legitimate campaign against\n\"terrorists\" it blames for a string of attacks on police posts and for burning\nhomes and civilian deaths. It says 26,747 non-Muslims have been displaced.\n\nFleeing Rohingya and rights monitors say the Myanmar army is conducting a\ncampaign of arson and killings to force them from their homes.\n\nTwo Bangladesh government sources said Myanmar had been laying landmines\nacross a section of its border for the past three days, possibly to prevent\nthe return of fleeing Rohingya.\n\nBangladesh will formally lodge a protest on Wednesday against the laying of\nland mines so close to the border, said the sources who had direct knowledge\nof the situation but asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of\nthe matter.\n\nA Myanmar military source said landmines were laid along the border in the\n1990s to prevent trespassing and the military had since tried to remove them,\nbut none had been planted recently.

{"_id":{"$oid":"59bd80112b6deeaf164b0de2"},"text":"(Brian Thevenot is a Reuters journalist. He was part of The Times-Picayune\nteam that won two Pulitzer Prizes for its coverage of Hurricane Katrina in\n2005.)\n\nBy Brian Thevenot\n\nHOUSTON (Reuters) - As I sat with Raeann Barber in the Houston convention\ncenter, surrounded by nearly 10,000 refugees from Hurricane Harvey, we figured\nout that we had nearly crossed paths 12 years ago - to the day - in the Lower\nNinth Ward of New Orleans.\n\nBarber, 36, used to live on Forstall Street, just east of the Industrial\nCanal, where a catastrophic levee breach sent a tidal wave into the\nimpoverished neighborhood.\n\nShe had picked a good time to have a seizure.\n\nJust before Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans, Barber was taken to Touro\nHospital in Uptown, which would soon be one of a precious few dry\nneighborhoods. Already disabled by epilepsy and a head-on car wreck at age 21,\nshe almost certainly would have died in the flood.\n\nAfter the worst of Katrina's winds had passed, I headed in the other\ndirection, from The Times-Picayune's newspaper offices, close to Uptown, to a\nbridge over the same canal, where I got our first look at the catastrophic\nflooding on the afternoon of Aug. 29, 2005.\n\nI passed Forstall Street in a civilian rescue boat that we would load with\npeople, a large dog and a duffel bag full of cats, all pulled from rooftops or\nsecond stories.\n\n\"There are going to be tons of dead people,\" our boat captain, Jerry Rayes,\naccurately predicted as we navigated down St. Claude Avenue.\n\nBarber's life was spared but upended. When the hospital evacuated, a staffer\ntold her: \"We'll take you to a safe place – the Superdome.\"\n\nAfter a week without power or running water, she was shuttled onto a bus to\nHouston, where she stayed - and now faces the trauma of another historic\nflood.\n\nAs images of Harvey's destructive power are broadcast worldwide, the obvious\ncomparisons to Katrina are everywhere.\n\nI can't sum it up any better than Barber did: \"Besides not having all the dead\nbabies and dead bodies out there, this is like Katrina all over again.\"\n\nKatrina took 1,833 lives, according to the Federal Emergency Management\nAgency.\n\nHarvey's grim toll is not yet taken, but current estimates reach as high as 30\ndeaths or suspected deaths.\n\nA MAN-MADE DISASTER\n\nThe divergent death tolls illuminate key differences between the two biblical\nfloods and their responses from emergency management officials.\n\nWhat people forget about Katrina – and many never fully understood – is that\nthe catastrophe stemmed from fatal flaws in a levee system constructed by the\nU.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\n\nThree key canals failed at water heights that were within their design\nspecifications. The water did not come over the tops of the levees - it\nscoured out the earth underneath walls that were not planted deeply enough.\n\nThe explosive failures made the water rise in minutes – not hours or days –\nwith a force that knocked houses into streets and drowned their inhabitants.\nOthers who escaped died later of exhaustion or sickness.\n\nNo one had anticipated Katrina's levee failures or planned for them.\n\nIn sharp contrast, government and nonprofit officials in Texas could see the\nthreat of Harvey clearly – and had the benefit of 12 years of lesson-learning\nfrom Katrina.\n\nBefore dumping torrential rains on Houston, Harvey's high winds ripped through\nthe small beach town of Rockport, Texas, demolishing hundreds of buildings but\ncausing relatively little flooding.\n\nHouston was spared the winds but got a historic measure of rain – which\nmeteorologists had predicted many days before the storm hit, allowing\nemergency and law enforcement officials to mobilize assets for search, rescue\nand shelter well in advance.\n\nThe lack of wind damage - and downed power lines – created an eerie glow of\nelectric lights reflecting off floodwaters. As I rode in a military rescue\nvehicle Monday night, I could see someone watching television in flooded home.\n\n'LITTLE WET RAT'\n\nI can't tell you how comforting it was to hear Raeann Barber talk on Tuesday,\nin an unmistakable accent from St. Bernard Parish, a swampy rural area\nadjacent to the Ninth Ward.\n\nAs a rising tide threatened her Southeast Houston apartment, Barber recalled\nthe seizure she suffered as Katrina targeted the Louisiana coast. She has\nlearned that high emotions - like panic from a hurricane - can trigger her\nepilepsy.\n\nSo she focused on pleasant thoughts as Harvey roared toward Texas -\nenvisioning the ocean, rainbows, anything to avoid another seizure. It worked.\n\nShe soon had water at her knees and sought refuge in a neighbor's second-story\napartment and waited for boats.\n\n\"I was a stuck little wet rat,\" she told me.\n\nIt was hardly Barber's first brush with death. She once sold drugs and carried\na gun. The head-on collision at 21 put her in a nursing home for four years,\nuntil shortly before Katrina.\n\n\"God must really love me,\" she said, sitting on her cot in the storm shelter.\n\"I survived selling drugs; I survived Katrina; and now I survived Harvey ...\nHe really must have a purpose for me.\"\n\nTALE OF TWO CONVENTION CENTERS\n\nThe scene around us at George R. Brown Convention Center could not have\ncontrasted more with the nightmarish images seared in my memory from the\nErnest N. Morial Convention Center in New Orleans.\n\nIt also marked a huge improvement over the shelter I saw last weekend in a\nschool in Rockport, where a 29-year-old aspiring screenwriter had taken on the\nmanagement of a facility with no power, running water or supplies.\n\nIn downtown Houston on Tuesday, nearly 10,000 refugees occupied a shelter\ninitially planned for 5,000. They had lights, air-conditioning, working\nbathrooms, ample food, water and medicine, and constant attention from\nhundreds of volunteers.\n\nThe outpouring of care for Houston's flood victims owes in part to the\nemergency community's deep study of Katrina's failures, said David Schoenick,\na Red Cross volunteer specializing in public and government relations.\n\nThe Red Cross made three fundamental changes since then: allowing refugees to\nbring pets into shelters, because many refused to be rescued without them\nduring Katrina; an intense focus on coordination with government, a key\nfailure in 2005; and a database to efficiently identify and deploy volunteers\nnear any disaster.\n\nThe \"shelter\" at the New Orleans convention center had not been planned at\nall. It filled up spontaneously after the Superdome - where Barber had stayed\n- had become overwhelmed.\n\nThe center had no power or running water; the bathrooms were horrific. Most\npeople had little food, water or hope as they waited days for the cavalry to\narrive in the form of the National Guard and buses to Houston.\n\nCellphones were down; smartphones hadn't been invented; no one had seen TV;\nFacebook was a college network; Twitter was a bird call. So when our reporting\ncrew came to the convention center to hand out a few skinny newspapers, they\nwere as popular as food.\n\nI saw four dead bodies in a rear storage room.

{"_id":{"$oid":"59bd80112b6deeaf164b0de6"},"text":"(Brian Thevenot is a Reuters journalist. He was part of The Times-Picayune\nteam that won two Pulitzer Prizes for its coverage of Hurricane Katrina in\n2005.)\n\nBy Brian Thevenot\n\nHOUSTON, Aug 30 (Reuters) - As I sat with Raeann Barber in the Houston\nconvention center, surrounded by nearly 10,000 refugees from Hurricane Harvey,\nwe figured out that we had nearly crossed paths 12 years ago - to the day - in\nthe Lower Ninth Ward of New Orleans.\n\nBarber, 36, used to live on Forstall Street, just east of the Industrial\nCanal, where a catastrophic levee breach sent a tidal wave into the\nimpoverished neighborhood.\n\nShe had picked a good time to have a seizure.\n\nJust before Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans, Barber was taken to Touro\nHospital in Uptown, which would soon be one of a precious few dry\nneighborhoods. Already disabled by epilepsy and a head-on car wreck at age 21,\nshe almost certainly would have died in the flood.\n\nAfter the worst of Katrina's winds had passed, I headed in the other\ndirection, from The Times-Picayune's newspaper offices, close to Uptown, to a\nbridge over the same canal, where I got our first look at the catastrophic\nflooding on the afternoon of Aug. 29, 2005.\n\nI passed Forstall Street in a civilian rescue boat that we would load with\npeople, a large dog and a duffel bag full of cats, all pulled from rooftops or\nsecond stories.\n\n\"There are going to be tons of dead people,\" our boat captain, Jerry Rayes,\naccurately predicted as we navigated down St. Claude Avenue.\n\nBarber's life was spared but upended. When the hospital evacuated, a staffer\ntold her: \"We'll take you to a safe place – the Superdome.\"\n\nAfter a week without power or running water, she was shuttled onto a bus to\nHouston, where she stayed - and now faces the trauma of another historic\nflood.\n\nAs images of Harvey's destructive power are broadcast worldwide, the obvious\ncomparisons to Katrina are everywhere.\n\nI can't sum it up any better than Barber did: \"Besides not having all the dead\nbabies and dead bodies out there, this is like Katrina all over again.\"\n\nKatrina took 1,833 lives, according to the Federal Emergency Management\nAgency.\n\nHarvey's grim toll is not yet taken, but current estimates reach as high as 30\ndeaths or suspected deaths.\n\nA MAN-MADE DISASTER\n\nThe divergent death tolls illuminate key differences between the two biblical\nfloods and their responses from emergency management officials.\n\nWhat people forget about Katrina – and many never fully understood – is that\nthe catastrophe stemmed from fatal flaws in a levee system constructed by the\nU.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\n\nThree key canals failed at water heights that were within their design\nspecifications. The water did not come over the tops of the levees - it\nscoured out the earth underneath walls that were not planted deeply enough.\n\nThe explosive failures made the water rise in minutes – not hours or days –\nwith a force that knocked houses into streets and drowned their inhabitants.\nOthers who escaped died later of exhaustion or sickness.\n\nNo one had anticipated Katrina's levee failures or planned for them.\n\nIn sharp contrast, government and nonprofit officials in Texas could see the\nthreat of Harvey clearly – and had the benefit of 12 years of lesson-learning\nfrom Katrina.\n\nBefore dumping torrential rains on Houston, Harvey's high winds ripped through\nthe small beach town of Rockport, Texas, demolishing hundreds of buildings but\ncausing relatively little flooding.\n\nHouston was spared the winds but got a historic measure of rain – which\nmeteorologists had predicted many days before the storm hit, allowing\nemergency and law enforcement officials to mobilize assets for search, rescue\nand shelter well in advance.\n\nThe lack of wind damage - and downed power lines – created an eerie glow of\nelectric lights reflecting off floodwaters. As I rode in a military rescue\nvehicle Monday night, I could see someone watching television in flooded home.\n\n'LITTLE WET RAT'\n\nI can't tell you how comforting it was to hear Raeann Barber talk on Tuesday,\nin an unmistakable accent from St. Bernard Parish, a swampy rural area\nadjacent to the Ninth Ward.\n\nAs a rising tide threatened her Southeast Houston apartment, Barber recalled\nthe seizure she suffered as Katrina targeted the Louisiana coast. She has\nlearned that high emotions - like panic from a hurricane - can trigger her\nepilepsy.\n\nSo she focused on pleasant thoughts as Harvey roared toward Texas -\nenvisioning the ocean, rainbows, anything to avoid another seizure. It worked.\n\nShe soon had water at her knees and sought refuge in a neighbor's second-story\napartment and waited for boats.\n\n\"I was a stuck little wet rat,\" she told me.\n\nIt was hardly Barber's first brush with death. She once sold drugs and carried\na gun. The head-on collision at 21 put her in a nursing home for four years,\nuntil shortly before Katrina.\n\n\"God must really love me,\" she said, sitting on her cot in the storm shelter.\n\"I survived selling drugs; I survived Katrina; and now I survived Harvey ...\nHe really must have a purpose for me.\"\n\nTALE OF TWO CONVENTION CENTERS\n\nThe scene around us at George R. Brown Convention Center could not have\ncontrasted more with the nightmarish images seared in my memory from the\nErnest N. Morial Convention Center in New Orleans.\n\nIt also marked a huge improvement over the shelter I saw last weekend in a\nschool in Rockport, where a 29-year-old aspiring screenwriter had taken on the\nmanagement of a facility with no power, running water or supplies.\n\nIn downtown Houston on Tuesday, nearly 10,000 refugees occupied a shelter\ninitially planned for 5,000. They had lights, air-conditioning, working\nbathrooms, ample food, water and medicine, and constant attention from\nhundreds of volunteers.\n\nThe outpouring of care for Houston's flood victims owes in part to the\nemergency community's deep study of Katrina's failures, said David Schoenick,\na Red Cross volunteer specializing in public and government relations.\n\nThe Red Cross made three fundamental changes since then: allowing refugees to\nbring pets into shelters, because many refused to be rescued without them\nduring Katrina; an intense focus on coordination with government, a key\nfailure in 2005; and a database to efficiently identify and deploy volunteers\nnear any disaster.\n\nThe \"shelter\" at the New Orleans convention center had not been planned at\nall. It filled up spontaneously after the Superdome - where Barber had stayed\n- had become overwhelmed.\n\nThe center had no power or running water; the bathrooms were horrific. Most\npeople had little food, water or hope as they waited days for the cavalry to\narrive in the form of the National Guard and buses to Houston.\n\nCellphones were down; smartphones hadn't been invented; no one had seen TV;\nFacebook was a college network; Twitter was a bird call. So when our reporting\ncrew came to the convention center to hand out a few skinny newspapers, they\nwere as popular as food.\n\nI saw four dead bodies in a rear storage room. One sat in a wheelchair, under\na blanket. Another lay covered on the floor, with a visible trail of blood\nseeping from the body. I had seen other bodies, bloated in the water, on Ninth\nWard boat trips.\n\nYet every hurricane I have covered offered exquisite beauty amid death and\ndevastation. It lies in the titanic clash between the power of nature and the\nhuman will to resist it.\n\nFrom Katrina, a singular memory stands out: the sight of Anita Roach, a\nconvention center refugee and the choir director at New Jerusalem Missionary\nBaptist Church.\n\nAmid suffering surrounding her, she raised her arms and belted out a gospel\nstandard that had comforted her through homelessness, the death of a son and\nthe flood that nearly killed her and her husband.\n\nA rising chorus joined her in the transcendent hymn:\n\nWhen the storm of life is raging\n\nStand by me, stand by me\n\nWhen this world is tossing me\n\nLike a ship on the raging sea\n\nThou who rulest the winds and water\n\nStand by me, stand by me (Reporting by Brian Thevenot; Editing by Tiffany Wu)\n\n","dateCreated":{"$date":"2017-08-30T22:52:19.000Z"},"charityOrg":"Red Cross","headline":"WITNESS-Hurricane annals: two Katrina survivors connect in Houston flood","guid":"tag:reuters.com,2017:newsml_L2N1LG24E","cause":"hurricane","geography":"US"}

I cried, I was angry,\" she told the Thomson Reuters\nFoundation.\n\n\"I knew from my friends who married young, they can't continue school, their\nlife is over,\" said Rini, now 22.\n\nRini's story is not uncommon in Indonesia, which is among the top 10 countries\nin the world with the highest number of child brides, according to campaign\ngroup Girls Not Brides.\n\nBut she stopped her child marriage and now, along with a group of teenage\ngirls, Rini is seeking to empower others to fight back through a new network,\nthe Youth Coalition for Girls.\n\nOne in four girls marry before they turn 18 in Indonesia, according to the\nUnited Nations' children agency UNICEF. On average over 3,500 Indonesian girls\nare married off every day.\n\nGlobally, 15 million girls become child brides each year, exposing them to\ngreater risks of exploitation, sexual violence, domestic abuse and death in\nchildbirth.\n\nCampaigners say poverty and tradition continue to drive underage marriage in\nIndonesia, a sprawling archipelago in Southeast Asia with a population of 250\nmillion people.\n\nSTRIKING A 'DEAL'\n\nThe U.N. defines child marriage as a formal marriage or informal union before\nage 18. However in Indonesia, the minimum age a girl can wed is 16, and 19 for\nboys.\n\nRini said her father, a construction labour, and mother, who runs a grocery\nstore from home, tried for two years to marry her to the man from her village\nto help the family's finances.\n\nThe youngest of five siblings, Rini resisted and her parents eventually\ndropped the idea after she struck a \"deal\" with them.\n\n\"I asked my parents how much they have spent on me, for my education. I said I\nwould repay them this money if they let me continue my studies. If they forced\nme to get married, they would not get a single cent,\" she said.\n\nThe coalition hopes stories like Rini's can inspire other girls to stand up\nfor their rights on issues ranging from child marriage to sexual violence.\n\nLaunched in March, the group now has 180 members aged between 15 and 24 in 11\nprovinces across the archipelago who want to tackle gender equality through\ntalks and book projects.\n\nThe coalition has a few survivors of child marriage and Rini, the group's\ndeputy head, said sharing their experiences help girls who are trapped to\nenvision a different future. \"I want to tell the girls, they are not alone.\nThey have the power to say no,\" she said.\n\nThe coalition also reaches out to parents to tell them the importance of\neducation and encourage them to let their children continue their studies\nuntil at they are at least 18.\n\nA university graduate, Rini has spoken about her experience in Japan and the\nNetherlands and her parents are proud of her.\n\nThe new coalition comes as women's rights campaigners in Indonesia broaden\ntheir movement by engaging men and religious leaders.\n\nIn April, female Muslim clerics issued an unprecedented fatwa - a religious\nedict which is not legally binding but influential among Muslims - to declare\nunderage marriage harmful and said its prevention was mandatory.\n\nRini admits the network is only in its infancy, but she hopes by taking this\nstep, politicians will start engaging youths themselves when drafting policies\nand enacting laws.\n\n\"My dream is to see boys and girls in Indonesia enjoy their rights equally,\"\nshe said.

In 2005, the proportion was 14.2 percent. * The number of hungry in 2016 was 815 million, up from 777 million in 2015. Numbers of hungry began to rise in 2014. * The largest number live in Asia (520 million), followed by Africa (243 million), and Latin America and the Caribbean (42 million). * Africa has the highest rates of hunger (20 percent), followed by Asia (11.7 percent) and Latin America and the Caribbean (6.6 percent) * Some 155 million children aged under five are stunted (too short for their age), 52 million suffer from wasting, meaning their weight is too low for their height. * An estimated 41 million children under five are overweight, a sign of malnutrition, that will increasingly affect the poor. * People living in countries affected by protracted crises are nearly 2.5 times more likely to be undernourished than people elsewhere. * 489 million hungry people, and 122 million children, live in countries affected by conflict. * Climate change, conflict and the global economic slowdown are the main causes of the recent increase in hunger.\n\nSource: The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2017 report,\nproduced by the U.N.

Water governance - in\nparticular, water tariffs and subsidies - must also be addressed, he said.\n\nThe region has the world's lowest water tariffs and spends the highest\nproportion of GDP on public water subsidies. Such policies lead to excessive\nuse of already scarce water supplies and are not sustainable, said Jägerskog.\n\nAnother challenge is that more than half of the wastewater collected in the\nregion is fed back into the environment untreated.\n\n\"Along with better water management, there is room for increasing the supply\nthrough non-conventional methods such as desalination and recycling,\" Guangzhe\nChen, senior director of the World Bank's global water practice, said in a\nstatement.\n\nImproved water management could bring considerable financial returns, the\nreport noted.\n\nGovernments could gain $10 billion annually by improving the storage and\ndelivery of irrigation water to users, while increasing agricultural\nproduction by up to 8 percent, the report said.\n\nEgypt, Syria and Iran - which have the largest proportion of irrigated land in\nthe region - are the countries that could benefit most.

{"_id":{"$oid":"59bd803c2b6deeaf164b0e1a"},"text":"By Thin Lei Win\n\nBANGKOK, Aug 21 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - F ast-dwindling mangroves in\nMyanmar's low-lying Ayeyarwady Delta, ravaged by decades of deforestation and\nconversion of land for agriculture and aquaculture, could find an unlikely\nsaviour - drones.\n\nMangroves protect coastlines in the face of storms and rising sea levels,\nabsorb carbon from the atmosphere, and boost fish stocks, experts say.\n\nYet Myanmar has lost more than 1 million hectares (about 2.5 million acres) of\nmangroves since 1980, said Arne Fjortoft, founder and secretary-general of\nWorldview International Foundation (WIF), which has worked with two local\nuniversities to restore mangroves in the Southeast Asian nation since 2012.\n\nIn the delta region, known as the country's rice bowl, only 16 percent of\noriginal mangrove cover remains, Fjortoft, former chairman of Norway's Liberal\nParty, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by e-mail.\n\nThere is an \"urgent need\" to restore mangroves to stem saltwater invasion of\nfarmland and shoreline erosion due to sea level rise, as well as to protect\nlives and property from storms and floods in coastal areas, he added.\n\nAn annual climate risk index by Germanwatch, a green research group, ranked\nMyanmar - which suffered decades of military rule - second among the 10\ncountries worst-affected by extreme weather from 1996 to 2015.\n\nWIF has so far planted some 3 million mangrove trees, but the task is\nlaborious and time-consuming.\n\nDrones, on the other hand, could plant trees 10 times faster and cut costs by\nhalf, according to UK-based start-up BioCarbon Engineering (BCE), whose CEO is\nan ex-NASA engineer who worked on the search for life on Mars.\n\nOnce the process is fully automated, a single pilot operating six drones can\nplant up to 100,000 trees per day, BCE says.\n\nIn late July, the inaugural BridgeBuilder Challenge, which awards $1 million\nin prize money for ideas with global impact, selected as one of its winners a\nproposal by BCE and WIF to test the use of BCE's drones to plant a million\nmangroves in Myanmar.\n\nThe plan covers 250 hectares and involves training and employing locals to\ncollect and prepare seeds, as well as to maintain, monitor and protect the\nfragile ecosystems.\n\nIt still requires approval from Myanmar's authorities, but Bremley Lyngdoh, a\nWIF board member who is applying for further grants, is hopeful work could\nstart later this year.\n\n\"We don't want another big storm to come and destroy a lot of lives and\nlivelihoods like in 2008,\" said Lyngdoh, referring to Cyclone Nargis which\ndevastated the Ayeyarwady Delta region, killing nearly 140,000 people.\n\nGLOBAL LAND GOAL\n\nDrones are particularly useful in complicated or dangerous terrain that is\nhard for people to access, said Irina Fedorenko, a co-founder of BCE.\n\nThey can help green large areas of land very fast, and could contribute to\nmeeting the international community's commitment to restore 350 million\nhectares of degraded forests and agricultural land by 2030, she said. That\ngoal will be near impossible without technology and innovation, she added.\n\nExperts say thriving mangrove ecosystems can store two to four times more\ncarbon than most other tropical forests, helping reduce planet-warming gases\nin the atmosphere, while slowing coastal erosion and shielding communities\nagainst tsunamis and storm surges.\n\nThey also provide breeding grounds for fish and other sea creatures. Mangroves\nhave been estimated to support 30 percent of Southeast Asia's fish catch, and\nalmost 100 percent of its shrimp catch.\n\nYet they are being destroyed at rates three to five times higher than global\ndeforestation, a 2014 U.N. report warned.\n\nBCE's technology, which works in two phases, aims to change that.\n\nFirst, drones flying 100 metres (328 ft) above the ground take highly\ndetailed, 3D images of the land while sensors record information such as soil\ntype, soil quality and moisture. The data is then used to create a planting\npattern, pinpointing the best spots and species to plant in each location.\n\nThen a drone uploaded with the mapping information flies 2 metres above the\nground, shooting biodegradable seed pods designed to enhance germination\nsuccess. A drone carrying 300 seed pods can cover 1 hectare in 18 minutes,\naccording to BCE.\n\nDRONES FOR GOOD\n\nFedorenko said BCE had tested around 3,000 species of plants in different\nconditions, including in Britain and a post-mining restoration project in\nAustralia, and was confident of finding the right combination for Myanmar.\n\n\"Mangroves grow very fast. We will see results in a year, but we will know\nwhat's working or not in six months, so there is time to modify the technology\nand the pods,\" she said.\n\nOnce perfected in Myanmar, the technology could help other large-scale\nrestoration projects, said WIF's Lyngdoh.\n\nLong associated with military operations, drones' growing availability,\nimproved performance and falling cost have led to their application in\nhumanitarian situations.\n\nIn June, Vanuatu's government announced a plan to test the use of drones to\ndeliver life-saving vaccines and health supplies to remote communities in the\nPacific archipelago.\n\nAnd Myanmar, with help from the United Nations' Food and Agriculture\nOrganization, will soon begin using drone-mapping technology to reduce\ndisaster risks to agriculture.

But\ncivil war quickly followed in 2013 after President Salva Kiir, an ethnic\nDinka, fired his deputy Riek Machar, a Nuer.\n\nSince then the conflict has been punctuated by gruesome massacres of civilians\nand extreme sexual violence. Ethnic militias have divided the country into a\npatchwork of fiefdoms.\n\n\"With Salva Kiir in power there will be no peace. He has to leave,\" said rebel\nColonel James Khor Chuol Lengdit.\n\nThe violence has paralyzed oil production, fueled hyperinflation and plunged\nparts of the country into famine briefly earlier this year. Nearly a third of\nSouth Sudan's 12 million citizens have fled their homes, creating Africa's\nbiggest refugee crisis since the Rwandan genocide.\n\nBefore the rebels attacked Kaya, a town near the Ugandan border and one of\nfour that were simultaneously attacked on Aug. 26, the fighters prayed\ntogether and told jokes.\n\nThen they tied their red strips of cloth around their heads and ran forwards,\nfiring, to positions near cement walls or corrugated iron market stalls.\n\nThe town was eerily empty; there were no civilians to be seen. Shops, a market\nand the school echoed with the sound of gunfire and explosions.\n\n\"In government-controlled areas there are no civilians.

{"_id":{"$oid":"59bd80512b6deeaf164b0e31"},"text":"By Jason Patinkin\n\nKAMPALA (Reuters) - United Nations peacekeepers in South Sudan are moving more\naggressively to protect civilians caught in the country's four-year civil war,\nafter years of criticism for failures that led to the sacking of the mission's\nmilitary chief last year.\n\nThis year, the U.N. Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) has rescued aid workers\nand U.N. staff during attacks, saved civilians from abduction by armed groups,\nand pushed past roadblocks to a massacre site.\n\n\"A lot has been done ... to improve UNMISS' ability to deliver on its\nprotection of civilians mandate,\" said Lauren Spink, a South Sudan specialist\nfor the independent U.S.-based advocacy group Center for Civilians in Conflict\n(CIVIC).\n\nSouth Sudan was the world's youngest country when it became independent from\nneighboring Sudan in 2011 following decades of conflict.\n\nBut the new nation dissolved into civil war less than two years later, after\nPresident Salva Kiir, an ethnic Dinka, fired his deputy, Riek Machar, a Nuer.\n\nSince then tens of thousands have died, and 3.5 million of the country's 12\nmillion citizens have fled their homes, creating Africa's largest refugee\ncrisis since Rwanda's 1994 genocide.\n\nBASE PROTECTION\n\nAs the war spread, families flooded into U.N. bases seeking protection. More\nthan 210,000 people now stay in six such bases, too fearful to go home.\n\nBetween December 2013 and July 2016, more than 100 civilians and four U.N.\npeacekeepers were killed in attacks on U.N. bases when peacekeepers didn't\nshoot back, fled, or delayed responding, according to data from the U.N. and\nCIVIC.\n\nBut a chastened UNMISS has gradually taken a tougher stance, boosted by the\nJanuary arrival of new chief David Shearer, a former New Zealand labor party\nleader.\n\n\"We are trying to make our peacekeeping more robust,\" Shearer told Reuters.\n\"Our peacekeepers are going to stand up to situations and challenge them.\"\n\nSeveral incidents demonstrate the change. In April, peacekeepers deployed to\nAburoc, a village on the Nile. After the U.N. arrived, rebels withdrew, and a\ngovernment offensive that had displaced 20,000 civilians paused. Aid workers\nthen intervened to stop a cholera outbreak.\n\nThe same month, peacekeepers went to Torit in the southeast to protect an\norphanage housing 250 children caught between the front lines.\n\nMongolian peacekeepers in northern Bentiu town have repeatedly rescued\ncivilians from abduction by armed groups this year, including one incident\nwhere they fired their weapons. Reuters was unable to find records of such\ninterventions for previous years.\n\n\"There is improvement,\" said Peter Ruach, who lives in the camp outside the\nU.N. base in Juba. A year ago government troops raped dozens of women who\nventured outside the fence to search for food.\n\n\"The Ethiopian battalion have cleared a buffer zone and they make sure that\nwhen women are going out for collection of firewood they are protected,\" he\nsaid.\n\nSince the buffer zone opened at the end of November, serious crimes like rape\nand murder reported near the camp had dropped from around 48 per month to\nbetween 1 and 5, the U.N. said.\n\nSTRAINED HISTORY\n\nU.N. peacekeepers have been in South Sudan since before independence, but\nfound themselves frequently criticized after war broke out by aid groups like\nDoctors Without Borders, who said they were not doing enough to protect\ncivilians.\n\nA year ago, peacekeepers at the U.N.'s main Juba base ignored desperate pleas\nfor help when government troops attacked a hotel a mile away, killing one aid\nworker and gang-raping others.\n\nIn following days, government troops raped dozens of Nuer women outside the\nsame base. Ten aid agencies released a joint statement accusing peacekeepers\nof failing to adequately patrol the area.\n\n\"The inability of UNMISS to protect civilians threatens to undermine any\nattempts at safety and security in the country and makes it impossible for\nhumanitarian agencies to provide the help that is so urgently needed,\"\nFrederick McCray, South Sudan Country Director at charity CARE, said at the\ntime.\n\nThe U.N. eventually launched an investigation that led to the firing of\nUNMISS' top general, Kenya's Johnson Ondieki, in November. In response, Kenya\npulled its troops from the peacekeeping mission.\n\nPROBLEMS REMAIN\n\nDespite more robust peacekeeping, the violence continues. The mission has\n12,000 armed peacekeepers and a budget of over a billion dollars. But that's\nnot enough to patrol a nation the size of France with under 300 km (185 miles)\nof paved roads.\n\nPeacekeepers were too stretched to deploy to Pagak, a rebel stronghold in the\nnortheast, where a government offensive has displaced thousands and forced\ndozens of aid workers to evacuate since July, Shearer said.\n\nU.N. patrols did not intervene in the northwestern town of Wau in April when a\ngovernment-aligned Dinka militia went door-to-door, executing at least 16\npeople of other ethnicities.\n\nPart of the problem is that the U.N. needs permission from South Sudan's\ngovernment for its presence. That can interfere with investigations or\ninterventions aimed at government forces.\n\nLast week, the government grounded U.N. flights after a dispute about the\ndeployment of an additional 4,000 troops to beef up the peacekeeping mission.\nThe government is reluctant to accept the new force.\n\n\"The U.N. cannot be totally independent in a country that is sovereign. They\nneed to be working in cooperation with the government ... They cannot run a\nparallel government,\" said presidential spokesman Ateny Wek Ateny.\n\nHe denied that government forces had killed or abused civilians.\n\n\"Government ... cannot do anything harmful to civilians that requires someone\nto come and protect them,\" Ateny said.\n\nShearer has responded to some roadblocks with public pressure. He took to U.N.\nradio to demand access to the Torit orphanage, and has ordered peacekeepers to\nhold their ground when their patrols are blocked by troops.\n\n\"We've had several instances of platoons sleeping at checkpoints for up to\nthree days until they were finally persistent enough to be allowed to go,\" he\nsaid.\n\nBut for some, U.N. intervention came too late. The U.N. did not arrive in\nAburoc until April, well after the government offensive began in January.\n\nIn the meantime, government forces killed civilians, bombing and shelling the\narea, and burning people alive in their homes, rights body Amnesty\nInternational said.\n\n(Editing by Giles Elgood)\n\n","dateCreated":{"$date":"2017-08-28T09:27:57.000Z"},"charityOrg":"Amnesty International","headline":"U.N. moves to protect South Sudan civilians after years of criticism","guid":"tag:reuters.com,2017:newsml_KCN1B80KA","cause":"war","geography":"SS"}

More\nthan 210,000 people now stay in six such bases, too fearful to go home.\n\nBetween December 2013 and July 2016, more than 100 civilians and four U.N.\npeacekeepers were killed in attacks on U.N. bases when peacekeepers didn't\nshoot back, fled, or delayed responding, according to data from the U.N. and\nCIVIC.\n\nBut a chastened UNMISS has gradually taken a tougher stance, boosted by the\nJanuary arrival of new chief David Shearer, a former New Zealand labour party\nleader.\n\n\"We are trying to make our peacekeeping more robust,\" Shearer told Reuters.\n\"Our peacekeepers are going to stand up to situations and challenge them.\"\n\nSeveral incidents demonstrate the change. In April, peacekeepers deployed to\nAburoc, a village on the Nile. After the U.N. arrived, rebels withdrew, and a\ngovernment offensive that had displaced 20,000 civilians paused. Aid workers\nthen intervened to stop a cholera outbreak.\n\nThe same month, peacekeepers went to Torit in the southeast to protect an\norphanage housing 250 children caught between the front lines.\n\nMongolian peacekeepers in northern Bentiu town have repeatedly rescued\ncivilians from abduction by armed groups this year, including one incident\nwhere they fired their weapons. Reuters was unable to find records of such\ninterventions for previous years.\n\n\"There is improvement,\" said Peter Ruach, who lives in the camp outside the\nU.N. base in Juba. A year ago government troops raped dozens of women who\nventured outside the fence to search for food.\n\n\"The Ethiopian battalion have cleared a buffer zone and they make sure that\nwhen women are going out for collection of firewood they are protected,\" he\nsaid.\n\nSince the buffer zone opened at the end of November, serious crimes like rape\nand murder reported near the camp had dropped from around 48 per month to\nbetween 1 and 5, the U.N. said.\n\nSTRAINED HISTORY\n\nU.N. peacekeepers have been in South Sudan since before independence, but\nfound themselves frequently criticised after war broke out by aid groups like\nDoctors Without Borders, who said they were not doing enough to protect\ncivilians.\n\nA year ago, peacekeepers at the U.N.'s main Juba base ignored desperate pleas\nfor help when government troops attacked a hotel a mile away, killing one aid\nworker and gang-raping others.\n\nIn following days, government troops raped dozens of Nuer women outside the\nsame base. Ten aid agencies released a joint statement accusing peacekeepers\nof failing to adequately patrol the area.\n\n\"The inability of UNMISS to protect civilians threatens to undermine any\nattempts at safety and security in the country and makes it impossible for\nhumanitarian agencies to provide the help that is so urgently needed,\"\nFrederick McCray, South Sudan Country Director at charity CARE, said at the\ntime.\n\nThe U.N. eventually launched an investigation that led to the firing of\nUNMISS' top general, Kenya's Johnson Ondieki, in November. In response, Kenya\npulled its troops from the peacekeeping mission.\n\nPROBLEMS REMAIN\n\nDespite more robust peacekeeping, the violence continues. The mission has\n12,000 armed peacekeepers and a budget of over a billion dollars. But that's\nnot enough to patrol a nation the size of France with under 300 km (185 miles)\nof paved roads.\n\nPeacekeepers were too stretched to deploy to Pagak, a rebel stronghold in the\nnortheast, where a government offensive has displaced thousands and forced\ndozens of aid workers to evacuate since July, Shearer said.\n\nU.N. patrols did not intervene in the northwestern town of Wau in April when a\ngovernment-aligned Dinka militia went door-to-door, executing at least 16\npeople of other ethnicities.\n\nPart of the problem is that the U.N. needs permission from South Sudan's\ngovernment for its presence. That can interfere with investigations or\ninterventions aimed at government forces.\n\nLast week, the government grounded U.N. flights after a dispute about the\ndeployment of an additional 4,000 troops to beef up the peacekeeping mission.\nThe government is reluctant to accept the new force.\n\n\"The U.N. cannot be totally independent in a country that is sovereign. They\nneed to be working in cooperation with the government ... They cannot run a\nparallel government,\" said presidential spokesman Ateny Wek Ateny.\n\nHe denied that government forces had killed or abused civilians.\n\n\"Government ... cannot do anything harmful to civilians that requires someone\nto come and protect them,\" Ateny said.\n\nShearer has responded to some roadblocks with public pressure. He took to U.N.\nradio to demand access to the Torit orphanage, and has ordered peacekeepers to\nhold their ground when their patrols are blocked by troops.\n\n\"We've had several instances of platoons sleeping at checkpoints for up to\nthree days until they were finally persistent enough to be allowed to go,\" he\nsaid.\n\nBut for some, U.N. intervention came too late. The U.N. did not arrive in\nAburoc until April, well after the government offensive began in January.\n\nIn the meantime, government forces killed civilians, bombing and shelling the\narea, and burning people alive in their homes, rights body Amnesty\nInternational said.

Music is life. It makes you relax and calms your nerves,\" said\nEzeala, 28, who credits music for obliterating the feelings of loneliness and\nloss that had brought him to the verge of suicide just a few months earlier.\n\nEzeala is a member of a band set up by medical charity Doctors for Human\nRights (MEDU) to help migrants who experienced torture and extreme violence\nbefore fleeing to a new life.\n\nFor an increasing number of migrants arriving in Italy bear mental as well as\nphysical scars due to abuse experienced in their country of origin or on their\nway to Europe, mainly in Libya, according to the Rome-based non-government\norganisation.\n\nMEDU coordinator Alberto Barbieri said most suffer from depression and post-\ntraumatic stress disorder, which can cause nightmares, flashbacks, insomnia,\nguilt and isolation.\n\n\"All together these symptoms seriously impair people's social, work, affective\nand interpersonal life and ... increase isolation,\" said Barbieri.\n\nMUSIC AS THERAPY\n\nAlmost 600,000 migrants arrived in Italy over the past four years. Most sailed\nfrom Libya in flimsy vessels operated by people smugglers. More than 13,000\nhave died trying to make the crossing.\n\nBut difficulties in securing work and learning Italian led to a sense of\nseclusion among many new arrivals who spend most of their day in reception\ncentres with little to do, added MEDU's cultural mediator Abdoulaye Toure, 39.\n\n\"Often the only opportunity they have to get out is coming here to listen (and\nplay) music,\" he said.\n\nSet up at the beginning of the year as support to clinical therapy, the MEDU\nMusic Band meets twice a week and has performed at several private and public\nevents, playing a mix of African pop, rap and reggae.\n\n\"Music allows (them) to be together, express emotions and feel part of\nsomething,\" said Barbieri.\n\nEzeala is a new addition to the group, having been referred to the charity\nafter attempting to take his own life, he said.\n\nHe fled Nigeria last year fearing arrest for backing the secession of an area\nin the southeast formerly known as Biafra.\n\nHis father and brother were shot dead during pro-secession protests in the\nsouthern state of Anambra in 2016, while he was beaten by security forces and\nhit by a stray bullet, he said.\n\nAmnesty International last year accused Nigerian security forces of killing at\nleast 150 Biafra separatists at peaceful rallies, which the military and\npolice denied.\n\nThe army said at the time that the separatists, often armed, had behaved\nviolently, killing several policeman and attacking both military and police\nvehicles.\n\n\"The military and other security agencies exercised maximum restraints despite\nthe flurry of provocative and unjustifiable violence,\" army spokesman Sani\nUsman said in a statement last year.\n\nAs Ezeala recovered, his family put him on a flight to Italy where he applied\nfor asylum, he said.\n\nBut after spending a few months in a reception centre, loneliness overwhelmed\nhim.\n\n\"I look at myself and I was like: 'what I am living here (for)? My father and\nbrother are dead, my mother is far, what I can do?'... it made me want to jump\nand end my life,\" he said.\n\nJoining the band gave him a sense of belonging.\n\n\"They are my family now,\" he said.\n\nINDUSTRIAL ABUSE\n\nMEDU said about 90 percent of more than 2,000 migrants assisted by its mobile\nhealth clinic over the past three years reported being exposed to torture or\nextreme violence - mostly at the hands of armed groups, criminal gangs and\nsmugglers.\n\n\"Unfortunately in Libya today ... violence and torture are practiced on\nindustrial scale,\" said Barbieri.\n\nAn overwhelming majority of African migrants who passed through Libya on the\nway to Italy witnessed or suffered a series of abuses including murder, rape\nand food deprivation, according to a study by British NGO Oxfam.\n\nIbrahim Jalloh, a singer from Sierra Leone in the MEDU band, said he was\nkidnapped and held for more than a year in Tripoli by a criminal group that\ndemanded a ransom from his family.\n\nHe was routinely beaten and when it became clear he couldn't get any money he\nwas put in a separate cell with others migrants, waiting to be executed, he\nsaid.\n\n\"If you don't pay, they kill you,\" said 34-year-old Jalloh.\n\nKnowing their fate was sealed, the group rioted when gunmen came to open the\ncell, he said, and he was hit in the head with the butt of a rifle, passed out\nand left for dead.\n\nHe woke up the next morning with many former inmates lying dead nearby and\nwalked out of the building. He was helped by a local man in a passing car who\ntook him to a doctor, housed him until recovery and gave him money to get on a\nboat to Italy.\n\n\"The trouble in Libya is that .. either you chose to die (there) or you risk\nto cross the Mediterranean Sea,\" he said.\n\nToure, the cultural mediator who also plays with the group, said music was\nhelping Jalloh and his band mates recover.\n\n\"Music has removed sadness from their faces. (Before) they would sit tense\nbecause of all they went through ... now they laugh and are happier,\" he said.\n(Reporting by Umberto Bacchi @UmbertoBacchi, Editing by Lyndsay Griffiths and\nBelinda Goldsmith; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the\ncharitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women's\nrights, trafficking, property rights, climate change and resilience.

Tobacco smoking killed 7.1 million people.\n\nDiets low in whole grains, fruit, nuts and seeds, fish oils and high in salt\nwere the most common risk factors, contributing to cases of obesity, high\nblood pressure, high blood sugar and high cholesterol.\n\nThe study found that deaths from firearms, conflict and terrorism have\nincreased globally, and that non-communicable, or chronic, diseases such as\ncardiovascular disease and diabetes caused 72 percent of all deaths worldwide.\n\nHeart disease was the leading cause of premature death in most regions and\nkilled 9.48 million people globally in 2016.\n\nMental illness was found to have a heavy toll on individuals and societies,\nwith 1.1 billion people living with psychological or psychiatric disorders and\nsubstance abuse problems in 2016.\n\nMajor depressive disorders ranked in the top 10 causes of ill health in all\nbut four countries worldwide.\n\nThe GBD is funded by the Bill \u0026amp; Melinda Gates Foundation global health\ncharity and gives data estimates on some 330 diseases, causes of death and\ninjuries in 195 countries and territories.

It did not explain how exactly the\nBloomberg charity lobbied.\n\nWhile the note mirrored some of India's tobacco lobby's positions - such as\nhow anti-smoking policies could adversely impact farmers - the government\nofficial said the investigation was not done at the behest of the industry.\n\n\"Anti-tobacco lobby wants to kill revenue generating activities,\" the official\nsaid.\n\nA health ministry official, however, said: \"We don't see tobacco as an\neconomic activity.\" He added that the health ministry was unaware of the home\nministry's note on Bloomberg Philanthropies.\n\nBROADER CRACKDOWN\n\nIndia has stepped up scrutiny of NGOs registered under the Foreign\nContribution Regulation Act (FCRA).\n\nIn 2015, the home ministry put the Ford Foundation on a watch list and\nsuspended Greenpeace India's FCRA licence, drawing criticism from the United\nStates.\n\nEarlier this year, the government banned foreign funding for the Public Health\nFoundation of India, a group backed by the Bill \u0026amp; Melinda Gates\nFoundation, saying it used foreign donations to \"lobby\" for tobacco-control\npolicy issues, \"which is prohibited under FCRA.\"\n\nIn the Bloomberg case, the home ministry note included a chart showing how\nfunds flowed from Bloomberg Philanthropies to its partner, the Campaign for\nTobacco-Free Kids, which was then funding five local FCRA-registered NGOs.\nThese NGOs, the note said, were being used by the Bloomberg charity for \"anti-\ntobacco lobbying activities.\"\n\nThe FCRA licence of at least one of them - the Institute of Public Health\n(IPH) Bengaluru - was not renewed in October, in part due to the home\nministry's note, the government official said.\n\nThe IPH said it was told by the home ministry that its licence was not being\nrenewed on the basis of a \"field agency report\", but no details were given. It\nwas unaware of the investigation on Bloomberg Philanthropies.\n\nIn April, the home ministry wrote to the federal health ministry, citing an\n\"inquiry into foreign funding\" for lobbying to change laws in India. The\nletter, seen by Reuters, mentioned the Bloomberg initiative and directed the\nhealth ministry to report on anti-tobacco lobbying by foreign donors in other\ncountries where tobacco is widely used.\n\nThe health ministry has not yet sent that report, another government official\nsaid. The health ministry did not respond to questions.\n\n(Reporting by Aditya Kalra in NEW DELHI, with additional reporting by Duff\nWilson in NEW YORK; Editing by Sanjeev Miglani and Ian Geoghegan)\n\n","dateCreated":{"$date":"2017-08-29T12:22:27.000Z"},"charityOrg":"Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation","headline":"EXCLUSIVE-Bloomberg charity scrutinised by India for anti-tobacco funding, lobbying - documents","guid":"tag:reuters.com,2017:newsml_L4N1L22TF","cause":"poverty","geography":"US"}

The Syrian government was \"not fit to lead\nand rule the people\", he said.\n\nThe Deir al-Zor military council, fighting as part of the U.S.-backed Syrian\nDemocratic Forces (SDF), has advanced towards Deir al-Zor from the eastern\nside of the Euphrates River since launching an offensive into the province a\nweek ago.\n\nGovernment forces, supported by the Russian air force and Iran-backed\nmilitias, have simultaneously advanced into Deir al-Zor from the west. Last\nweek, they broke an Islamic State siege of the provincial capital, Deir al-Zor\ncity, which sits on the western bank of the river.\n\nDeir al-Zor province is Islamic State's last major foothold in Syria and Iraq.\nRich in oil, it is bisected by the Euphrates River and abuts Iraq.\n\nThe Russian- and U.S.-backed campaigns against Islamic State in Syria have\nmostly stayed out of each other's way as the sides seek to avoid conflict,\nwith the Euphrates often acting as a dividing line between the sides. Talks\nhave been underway to extend a formal demarcation line that has separated the\ncampaigns, officials have said.\n\nAbu Khawla warned government forces and their militia allies against firing\nacross the river as his fighters close in - something he said had happened in\nrecent days.\n\n\"Now we have 3 km between us and the eastern riverbank, once our forces reach\nthe area, any shot fired into that area we will consider an attack on the\nmilitary council,\" he said.\n\n\"We have notified the regime and Russia that we are coming to the Euphrates\nriverbank, and they can see our forces advancing,\" he said. \"We do not allow\nthe regime or its militias to cross to the eastern riverbank.\"\n\n\"MOVING FORCEFULLY AND QUICKLY\"\n\n\"Every village around the eastern riverbank of the Euphrates river until the\nIraqi-Syrian border is a goal for our forces,\" he said. \"We are moving\nforcefully and quickly. We do not have a timeline, but we hope soon to free\nthe entire eastern bank.\"\n\nReflecting the demarcation line, the U.S.-led coalition said on Thursday the\nSDF was not planning to enter Deir al-Zor city.\n\nBut while Deir al-Zor city was not an SDF target, Abu Khawla did not rule out\nthe possibility that it may become one, saying people in the city wanted to be\nliberated from \"the regime and Daesh at the same time\".\n\nBut \"right now, we have a schedule that we’re following which is the\nliberation of the eastern riverbanks of the Euphrates\", he said.\n\nHe said Islamic State had \"shown fierce resistance\" when SDF fighters entered\nthe outskirts of Deir al-Zor on the eastern bank of the Euphrates. \"The\nbattles are continuous,\" he said.\n\nAbu Khawla, who is in his early 30s, said 10,000 fighters were taking part in\nthe Deir al-Zor campaign, the bulk of them members of Arab tribes from eastern\nSyria. The campaign is supported by the Kurdish militia that dominate the SDF.\n\n\"All our soldiers’ training (is) in the Coalition training camps, they oversee\nour training and our armament,\" he said.\n\nAbu Khawla was a member of a Free Syrian Army rebel group in Deir al-Zor until\nIslamic State took over most of the province in 2014 at the height of its\nexpansion in Syria and Iraq. He fled to Turkey before returning to Syria and\njoining the SDF.\n\n\"Now we are setting up a civil council parallel to the military council of\nDeir al-Zor, and this civilian council will run all areas freed from (Islamic\nState),\" he said.

He first\nmade the announcement at a special meeting of the Frente Amplio (FA) governing\nparty.\n\nMerkel suggests Iran-style nuclear talks to end North Korea crisis\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel told a newspaper she would be prepared to\nbecome involved in a diplomatic initiative to end the North Korean nuclear and\nmissiles program, and suggested the Iran nuclear talks could be a model. South\nKorea on Saturday braced for a possible further missile test by North Korea as\nit marked its founding anniversary, just days after its sixth and largest\nnuclear test rattled global financial markets and further escalated tensions\nin the region.\n\nRed Cross fills U.N. void in Myanmar's violence-torn region\n\nThe Red Cross organizations are scaling up operations in Myanmar's violence-\nriven northwest, after the United Nations had to suspend activities there\nfollowing government suggestions that its agency had supported Rohingya\ninsurgents. While the world has focused on Bangladesh, where some 290,000\nRohingya have fled an army crackdown on the militants in two weeks, a serious\nhumanitarian crisis is also unfolding on the Myanmar side, aid workers say.\n\nHurricane Irma barrels toward Caribbean, southern United States\n\nHurricane Irma, a powerful Category 4 storm, plowed toward the Caribbean and\nthe southern United States on Tuesday as islands in its path braced for\npossible life-threatening winds, storm surges and flooding. Hurricane warnings\nand watches were in effect for territories that dot the West Indies, including\nparts of the Leeward Islands, the British and U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto\nRico, in preparation for a storm that was intensifying with 140 mph (220 kph)\nwinds, the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) said.\n\nAmid tension, Trump and Turkey's Erdogan agree to strengthen ties\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump and Turkey's Tayyip Erdogan spoke on Saturday and\nagreed to continue to work toward stronger ties and regional security,\nErdogan's office said, a day after he lashed out at U.S. authorities for\nindicting one of his ex-ministers. Ties between the United States and its NATO\nally have been strained by Washington's support for the YPG Kurdish fighters\nin the battle against Islamic State in Syria. Turkey considers the YPG a\nterrorist group.\n\nRussia berates German defense minister for war games remarks\n\nRussia's Defence Ministry on Saturday criticized German Defence Minister\nUrsula von der Leyen, saying it was bewildered by her assertion that Moscow\nplanned to send more than 100,000 troops to war games on NATO's eastern flank\nthis month. On Thursday, the German defense minister said the war games, code\nnamed Zapad or \"West\", were a clear \"demonstration of capabilities and power\nof the Russians\".\n\nDeath toll from massive Mexican quake rises to 65\n\nThe death toll from the massive earthquake that struck Mexico on Thursday\nnight has risen to 65, as more victims were registered in the poor southern\nstates hardest hit by the disaster, authorities said on Saturday.

{"_id":{"$oid":"59bd80922b6deeaf164b0ec0"},"text":"By Helen Murphy and Luis Jaime Acosta\n\nNORTHWESTERN JUNGLES, Colombia (Reuters) - Colombia's ELN guerrilla group said\na Russian-Armenian citizen it held hostage for six months was killed in April\nwhile trying to escape, a startling admission that risks throwing current\npeace talks with the government into jeopardy.\n\nIn a rare interview, a commander of the National Liberation Army, Colombia's\nlast active guerrilla group, said that ransoms from kidnappings were necessary\nto keep its fighters in the field and that peace would be impossible without\nstate funding to feed and clothe the rebels.\n\nThe ELN seized Arsen Voskanyan in November. The group claimed that he was\ncollecting endangered, poisonous frogs in the jungles of the northwestern\ndepartment of Choco and accused him of wanting to smuggle wildlife overseas.\n\nAfter his lengthy captivity, Voskanyan was shot when he grabbed a hand grenade\nin a bid to escape, according to the ELN commander, who would only give his\nnom-de-guerre Yerson.\n\n\"He's dead,\" Yerson told Reuters in a remote area along the banks of a river\nthat sees frequent combat between the leftist rebels, government troops and\nright-wing paramilitaries.\n\n\"The grenade exploded ... several of our boys were wounded, the entire unit of\nfive boys. He fled, he was shot and killed ... The issue of his body will be\nnegotiated,\" he said, adding that the death took place within his unit. Yerson\nsupplied no evidence to back up his assertions.\n\nAnother person with knowledge of the matter also subsequently confirmed that\nVoskanyan had been killed.\n\nReuters could not independently confirm the circumstances surrounding\nVoskanyan's death.\n\nColombia's government said it knows nothing of the ELN's claim and the last it\nknew was a statement from the ELN that said he had escaped.\n\n\"The responsibility is with the ELN,\" the senior official said, asking not to\nbe named.\n\nThe Russian Embassy in Colombia, Colombia's High Peace Commissioner and the\nForeign Ministry in Moscow did not immediately respond to requests for\ncomment.\n\nThe ELN's practice of kidnapping civilians is a key issue at peace talks\ntaking place in the Ecuadorean capital of Quito. The fact that Voskanyan was\nkilled as talks progress and the ELN failed to inform the government may\ncomplicate already tricky negotiations to end 53 years of war and make the\nneed to agree a ceasefire more pressing.\n\n\"It makes it urgent to get a bilateral, verifiable ceasefire as soon as\npossible so this doesn't keep happening,\" leftist Senator Antonio Navarro\nWolff, who once belonged to now-demobilized urban guerrilla group the M-19,\ntold Reuters.\n\nYerson and his troops said they are not optimistic a peace agreement can be\nreached because neither side will give ground on kidnapping.\n\nThe ELN has refused to stop taking hostages for ransom, launching bomb attacks\nand extorting foreign oil and mining companies while talks are ongoing.

{"_id":{"$oid":"59bd80932b6deeaf164b0eca"},"text":"By Sarah Dadouch and Angus McDowall\n\nBEIRUT (Reuters) - U.S.-led warplanes on Wednesday blocked a convoy of Islamic\nState fighters and their families from reaching territory the group holds in\neastern Syria and struck some of their comrades traveling to meet them, a\ncoalition spokesman said.\n\nThe strikes were aimed at stopping an evacuation deal for Islamic State\nfighters to leave their enclave on the Lebanon-Syria border for areas they\nhold in eastern Syria, arranged by the Lebanese Hezbollah group and the Syrian\narmy.\n\nIt was part of a ceasefire agreed after offensives last week by the Lebanese\narmy on one front, and the Syrian army and Hezbollah on another, that pushed\nIslamic State back into a small part of its enclave straddling the frontier.\n\nThe deal has been criticized by the coalition and by Iraq, whose army is also\nfighting Islamic State in areas contiguous with the eastern Syria region to\nwhich the convoy was headed.\n\nThe convoy, carrying 308 militants and 331 civilians according to Hezbollah,\nis now effectively stranded, unable to move forward into Islamic State\nterritory.\n\nIt shows how easily such evacuations to other areas, which the government of\nSyrian President Bashar al-Assad has increasingly used to push rebel pockets\nto surrender, can be derailed in a conflict with many sides.\n\nA commander in the military alliance supporting Assad said the coalition had\ncontacted the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, which is accompanying the convoy and\nwarned that if it entered Islamic State territory, it might attack.\n\nIslamic State is on the back foot in both Syria and Iraq, losing swathes of\nits territory and its most important towns and cities after taking advantage\nof chaos including the six-year civil war in Syria to win ground.\n\nIn Syria, the U.S.-led coalition is backing an alliance of Kurdish and Arab\nmilitias in the north which are assaulting the jihadist group's former de\nfacto capital of Raqqa.\n\nThe Russian-backed Syrian army and allied Shi'ite militia from Iraq and\nLebanon including Hezbollah have this year seized most of the central desert\nfrom the group, and are advancing eastwards to relieve the army's besieged\nenclave in Deir al-Zor.\n\nThe coalition strikes to block the convoy moving into Islamic State territory\ntook place east of Humeima, near the edge of land held by the Syrian\ngovernment, coalition spokesman Ryan Dillon told Reuters.\n\n\"We did crater the road and destroyed a small bridge to prevent this convoy\nfrom moving further east,\" Dillon told Reuters by phone.\n\nHe later said the coalition had struck vehicles containing Islamic State\nfighters that were heading to that area from deeper inside the territory they\ncontrol to the east.\n\nHe did not know if the evacuation convoy, which contains buses of fighters and\ntheir family members, as well as ambulances carrying wounded fighters, was now\nin Islamic State or Syrian government territory.\n\nMILITARY AID\n\nOn Tuesday morning a Hezbollah-run military media unit reported the convoy had\nreached an exchange point into Islamic State territory.\n\nThe evacuation deal also involved Islamic State revealing the fate of nine\nLebanese soldiers it took captive in its border enclave in 2014, and\nsurrendering Hezbollah and Syrian army prisoners and bodies in east Syria.\n\nThe commander in the pro-Assad military alliance said it was considering an\nalternative location for the convoy to cross into Islamic State territory.\n\n\"Now things are moving to change the place from Humeima and head north towards\nSukhna,\" the commander said.\n\n\"We're not bound by these agreements,\" Dillon said, apparently referring to\nthe ceasefire deal. \"They're clearly fighters and they're moving to another\nlocation to fight yet again.\n\n\"In accordance with the law of armed conflict ... we will strike them if we\nare able to do so,\" he said, adding that direct strikes on the convoy would\nonly take place if the militants could be separated from civilians.\n\nBrett McGurk, the U.S. envoy to the coalition, criticized the evacuation deal\nin a statement early on Wednesday before the strikes were reported, saying:\n\"Relocating terrorists from one place to another for someone else to deal with\nis not a lasting solution\".\n\nSeparately, the leader of Hezbollah, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, defended the\nLebanese group's involvement in the evacuation deal in a statement responding\nto criticism of the move from Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi.\n\nAbadi said on Tuesday: \"Transporting this number of terrorists from long\ndistance to eastern Syria adjacent to Iraqi borders is unacceptable\".\n\nNasrallah said it was a Hezbollah deal agreed upon by the Syrian leadership,\nthat the fighters were few in number, and were being moved from one front\nHezbollah was fighting in to another.\n\nLebanon is a major recipient of U.S. and British military aid.

U.S.-led warplanes on Wednesday blocked a convoy of\nIslamic State fighters and their families from reaching territory the group\nholds in eastern Syria and struck some of their comrades travelling to meet\nthem, a coalition spokesman said.\n\nThe strikes were aimed at stopping an evacuation deal for Islamic State\nfighters to leave their enclave on the Lebanon-Syria border for areas they\nhold in eastern Syria, arranged by the Lebanese Hezbollah group and the Syrian\narmy.\n\nIt was part of a ceasefire agreed after offensives last week by the Lebanese\narmy on one front, and the Syrian army and Hezbollah on another, that pushed\nIslamic State back into a small part of its enclave straddling the frontier.\n\nThe deal has been criticised by the coalition and by Iraq, whose army is also\nfighting Islamic State in areas contiguous with the eastern Syria region to\nwhich the convoy was headed.\n\nThe convoy, carrying 308 militants and 331 civilians according to Hezbollah,\nis now effectively stranded, unable to move forward into Islamic State\nterritory.\n\nIt shows how easily such evacuations to other areas, which the government of\nSyrian President Bashar al-Assad has increasingly used to push rebel pockets\nto surrender, can be derailed in a conflict with many sides.\n\nA commander in the military alliance supporting Assad said the coalition had\ncontacted the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, which is accompanying the convoy and\nwarned that if it entered Islamic State territory, it might attack.\n\nIslamic State is on the back foot in both Syria and Iraq, losing swathes of\nits territory and its most important towns and cities after taking advantage\nof chaos including the six-year civil war in Syria to win ground.\n\nIn Syria, the U.S.-led coalition is backing an alliance of Kurdish and Arab\nmilitias in the north which are assaulting the jihadist group's former de\nfacto capital of Raqqa.\n\nThe Russian-backed Syrian army and allied Shi'ite militia from Iraq and\nLebanon including Hezbollah have this year seized most of the central desert\nfrom the group, and are advancing eastwards to relieve the army's besieged\nenclave in Deir al-Zor.\n\nThe coalition strikes to block the convoy moving into Islamic State territory\ntook place east of Humeima, near the edge of land held by the Syrian\ngovernment, coalition spokesman Ryan Dillon told Reuters.\n\n\"We did crater the road and destroyed a small bridge to prevent this convoy\nfrom moving further east,\" Dillon told Reuters by phone.\n\nHe later said the coalition had struck vehicles containing Islamic State\nfighters that were heading to that area from deeper inside the territory they\ncontrol to the east.\n\nHe did not know if the evacuation convoy, which contains buses of fighters and\ntheir family members, as well as ambulances carrying wounded fighters, was now\nin Islamic State or Syrian government territory.\n\nMILITARY AID\n\nOn Tuesday morning a Hezbollah-run military media unit reported the convoy had\nreached an exchange point into Islamic State territory.\n\nThe evacuation deal also involved Islamic State revealing the fate of nine\nLebanese soldiers it took captive in its border enclave in 2014, and\nsurrendering Hezbollah and Syrian army prisoners and bodies in east Syria.\n\nThe commander in the pro-Assad military alliance said it was considering an\nalternative location for the convoy to cross into Islamic State territory.\n\n\"Now things are moving to change the place from Humeima and head north towards\nSukhna,\" the commander said.\n\n\"We're not bound by these agreements,\" Dillon said, apparently referring to\nthe ceasefire deal. \"They're clearly fighters and they're moving to another\nlocation to fight yet again.\n\n\"In accordance with the law of armed conflict ... we will strike them if we\nare able to do so,\" he said, adding that direct strikes on the convoy would\nonly take place if the militants could be separated from civilians.\n\nBrett McGurk, the U.S. envoy to the coalition, criticised the evacuation deal\nin a statement early on Wednesday before the strikes were reported, saying:\n\"Relocating terrorists from one place to another for someone else to deal with\nis not a lasting solution\".\n\nSeparately, the leader of Hezbollah, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, defended the\nLebanese group's involvement in the evacuation deal in a statement responding\nto criticism of the move from Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi.\n\nAbadi said on Tuesday: \"Transporting this number of terrorists from long\ndistance to eastern Syria adjacent to Iraqi borders is unacceptable\".\n\nNasrallah said it was a Hezbollah deal agreed upon by the Syrian leadership,\nthat the fighters were few in number, and were being moved from one front\nHezbollah was fighting in to another.\n\nLebanon is a major recipient of U.S. and British military aid. It says its\noffensive against Islamic State last week was separate to the simultaneous one\nmade against the same pocket from inside Syria by the Syrian army and\nHezbollah, regarded by the U.S. and Britain as a terrorist group.\n\nOn Wednesday the Lebanese army said its head General Joseph Aoun had been\nphoned by the commander of U.S. Central Command Joseph Votel congratulating\nhim on the offensive and pledging to continue arming Lebanon's army.\n(Reporting by Sarah Dadouch, Angus McDowall, Laila Bassam and John Davison in\nBeirut, Ahmed Tolba in Cairo and Ahmed Rashid in Baghdad; Editing by Alison\nWilliams and Jonathan Oatis)\n\n","dateCreated":{"$date":"2017-08-30T23:18:58.000Z"},"charityOrg":"Red Cross","headline":"UPDATE 4-U.S.-led jets strike in Syria to block Islamic State evacuation deal","guid":"tag:reuters.com,2017:newsml_L8N1LG4N0","cause":"war","geography":"LB"}

Homes, roads, bridges,\nschools, hospitals, electricity plants and water systems are in ruins, ICRC\nsaid.\n\nMany people are living in their ruined houses, said Layal Neaimeh, deputy head\nof ICRC's sub-delegation in Mosul.\n\nThey include the few who stayed throughout the military offensive, families\nwho returned home and those displaced from other neighbourhoods.\n\n\"They are in quite a desperate situation.... They don't have any resources to\npurchase the already-limited goods available on the market,\" she said.\n\n\"Families have no stocks of food whatsoever. They don't even have half a kilo\nof rice,\" she said, adding that many were living off tea and bread.\n\nPeople are also being wounded by unexploded ordnance hidden under the rubble\nof their homes, ICRC said.\n\nNearly 1 million civilians fled Mosul in the last three years, according to\nthe United Nations.\n\nIslamic State turned the city into the stronghold of a \"caliphate\" they said\nwould take over the world.\n\nA 100,000-strong alliance of Iraqi government units, Kurdish Peshmerga\nfighters and Shi'ite militias launched an offensive to recapture the northern\ncity from the militants in October, with key air and ground support from a\nU.S.-led coalition.\n\nThey cleared East Mosul of militants in January.

We shall not allow\nirresponsible elements to start trouble,\" he said, adding that some ethnic\nviolence was \"fuelled by political mischief makers\".\n\nBuhari, a 74-year-old northern Muslim who took office in May 2015, handed over\npower to his deputy, Christian southerner Yemi Osinbajo, when he travelled to\nBritain on May 7 for treatment of an unspecified ailment.\n\nOsinbajo held talks in June with regional leaders in an effort to quell\ntension after Muslim activists demanded the eviction of Igbo people from the\nnorth over their calls for the creation of a separate Biafra state.\n\nThe tensions echoed the build up to a civil war over the secession of Biafra\nin 1967 which ended with Nigeria's victory in 1970, after an estimated 1\nmillion people died.\n\nBuhari also said Nigeria's security agencies should not let successes achieved\nagainst Islamist militant group Boko Haram in the last 18 months \"be a sign to\nrelax\", adding that Nigeria would \"reinforce and reinvigorate\" the fight\nagainst the insurgents.\n\nSuicide bomb attacks and raids by Boko Haram in the northeast have increased\nin the last few months, killing at least 170 people since June 1, according a\nReuters tally. Buhari had said in December 2016 that the group's main base had\nfallen.\n\nNigeria, an OPEC member which has Africa's biggest economy, is in its first\nrecession in 25 years which was largely caused by low oil prices and the\nimpact of attacks on energy facilities last year in the Niger Delta.\n\nBuhari said it was in the interest of Nigerians to come together to face the\nchallenge of economic security.

Critics say he is not doing enough to\nliberalise politics in a country where the king enjoys absolute authority.\n\nAmnesty International also denounced the crackdown, urging the authorities to\nreveal the whereabouts of the detainees and give them access to families and\nlawyers.\n\n\"In recent years we cannot recall a week in which so many prominent Saudi\nArabian figures have been targeted in such a short space of time,\" said Samah\nHadid, the group's director of campaigns in the Middle East.\n\n\"It is clear that the new leadership under Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman is\nsending a chilling message: freedom of expression will not be tolerated, we\nare coming after you.\"\n\nA government spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nCALL FOR PROTESTS\n\nAll public protests are banned in Saudi Arabia, as are political parties.\nLabour unions are illegal, the media are controlled and criticism of the royal\nfamily can lead to prison.\n\nRiyadh says it does not have political prisoners, but senior officials have\nsaid monitoring of activists is needed to maintain social stability.\n\nThe al-Saud family has always regarded Islamist groups as the biggest internal\nthreat to its rule over a country in which appeals to religious sentiment\ncannot be lightly dismissed and an al Qaeda campaign a decade ago killed\nhundreds.\n\nIslamist movements such as the Muslim Brotherhood, which originated in Egypt\nand briefly held power there after the 2011 Arab Spring, represent an\nideological threat to Saudi Arabia's dynastic system of rule.\n\nThe Brotherhood-inspired Sahwa movement agitated in the 1990s to bring\ndemocracy to Saudi Arabia and criticised the ruling family for corruption,\nsocial liberalisation and working with the West, including allowing U.S.\ntroops into the kingdom during the 1991 Iraq war.\n\nThe Sahwa were weakened by a mixture of repression and co-optation, but remain\nactive.\n\nSaudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic and\ntransport links with Qatar in June over its alleged support for Islamists\nincluding the Brotherhood -- a charge Doha denies.\n\nAt a mosque in central Riyadh that protest organisers had identified as one of\nseveral potential gathering spots, the imam warned worshippers against\ndemonstrating.\n\n\"All the groups that exist today and call for political action or aspire to\nrule -- they are all misguided, deviant groups headed by the Muslim\nBrotherhood,\" he said.\n\nMost people seemed to heed that message, with no demonstrations reported\nacross the kingdom.

Putin, due to attend a summit of the BRICS nations in\nChina next week, said the only way to de-escalate tensions was via talks, and\nSergei Lavrov, his foreign minister, said Washington not Pyongyang should take\nthe initiative on that.\n\nFrankfurt to evacuate thousands as huge WWII bomb defused\n\nFrankfurt city officials have warned that Germany's financial capital could\ngrind to a halt on Monday if residents don't heed orders to vacate their homes\nto allow the defusing of a massive World War Two bomb.

Nearly 400 people have died in fighting in the far\nnorth of the state after Rohingya militants attacked police posts and an army\nbase a week ago, provoking a major army counteroffensive.\n\nRussia, digesting U.S. diplomatic retaliation, pledges 'harsh' response\n\nRussia said on Friday it would respond harshly to any U.S. measures designed\nto hurt it, a day after the United States told Moscow to close its San\nFrancisco consulate and buildings in Washington and New York. The warning,\nfrom Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, came as Russia said it was weighing a\nresponse to the U.S. move that will force it to shutter two trade missions in\nthe United States as well as the San Francisco consulate by Sept. 2.\n\nFrench police arrest man near Eiffel Tower\n\nFrench police said they arrested a man near the Eiffel Tower in Paris on\nFriday night, after media reports of a security alert. \"A person was arrested,\nthe incident is finished,\" an official at Paris police said. \"He wasn't armed,\nwe'll know more about his motives tomorrow,\" the official added.\n\nBrazilian prosecutors want Lula absolved in corruption case\n\nFormer Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva should be cleared of any\nwrongdoing in one of several corruption cases pending against him in federal\ncourt due to a lack of evidence, prosecutors said on Friday.

Mexican Red\nCross workers were staffing shelters in three Texas cities. \"We are more than\nglad to be helpful,\" said Gustavo Santillan.\n\nLarge employers, universities and transit services reopened or began full\nschedules on Tuesday, with floodwaters receded and the Labor Day weekend\nbehind them.

The storm killed as many\nas 60 people, dumped more than 50 inches (127 cm) of rain and caused damages\nestimated as high as $180 billion, including to 203,000 homes.\n\nOil refineries, pipelines and shipping channels in the nation's energy center\nhave begun a gradual return to operations. Exxon Mobil on Tuesday said its\nfuel terminals in the Houston area were supplying gasoline and it continues to\nwork on reopening a shuttered Baytown oil refinery. Motiva Enterprises,\noperator of the nation's largest refinery, said it is in the process of\nrestarting operations at its Port Arthur, Texas, plant.\n\nSome industry stalwarts were still out of commission though. ConocoPhillips\nclosed its Houston headquarters through Sept. 11. BP's Houston campus suffered\nsevere flooding and remained closed. Portions may be out of use until\nDecember, Chief Executive Bob Dudley told Reuters. About 650 of BP's more than\n5,000 Houston area full-time staff reported damage to their homes.\n\n\"I’ve got to get work done but I don’t think it’ll be a productive day,” said\nDaniel Semetko, 60, a Houston energy company worker, citing the number of\npeople who were out of their homes due to storm damage.\n\nWith extensive property damage across the region, local and federal\nprosecutors formed a task force to investigate reports of home repair fraud\nand people posing as police to facilitate theft and other crimes, officials\nsaid. About 80 investigations into complaints were underway, said David Green,\na Department of Homeland Security special agent.\n\nHouston's school district, the nation's seventh largest, remains closed this\nweek to repair flooded schools.

Brown Convention Center over the weekend with a\nplan to house 5,000 people and be run largely by American Red Cross\nvolunteers. The center's size quickly doubled, as people streamed in from\nareas south and west of the city. Despite promising two more \"mega\" centers\nearly Tuesday, Houston opened one, at a basketball arena, and two smaller\ncenters.\n\nThat proved too little for county officials who set up their own location as\nan outbreak of looting and armed robberies prompted the city to order an\nindefinite curfew from midnight to 5 a.m. (0500 to 1000 GMT).\n\nHouston Police Chief Art Acevedo said late Tuesday individuals impersonating\npolice officers knocked on doors in at least two parts of the city telling\nresidents to evacuate their homes.\n\nSaying it spent days trying to coordinate an emergency plan with city, federal\nand county officials, Harris County officials late Tuesday decided to open a\nseparate shelter for 10,000 people at a county-owned exhibition hall.\n\n\"The Red Cross was pretty much overwhelmed,\" the county's chief administrator,\nEd Emmett, said at a news conference late Tuesday. After joint efforts didn't\ncome together, Emmett said officials decided \"we can't wait. We need to get\nthis done.\"\n\nA county-owned exhibition hall, the NRG Center, was opened at 10 p.m. local\ntime Tuesday. Emmett said it would be staffed in part by members of the\nNational Guard.\n\nMore than 3,000 Houston homes were underwater and thousands more were\nthreatened by two reservoirs swollen by an estimated 35 inches (90 cm) of\nrain.\n\nIn Brazoria County south of Houston, a levee broke on Tuesday morning, and the\ncounty's chief administrator urged residents to \"get out now.\"\n\nMandatory evacuation orders covered Brazoria, Galveston and Fort Bend counties\nsouth and west of Houston, and officials issued calls for people to leave\nvoluntarily across the region.\n\nSome 9,000 people were at the nearly 2-million-square-foot Houston convention\ncenter early Tuesday, and local officials began searching for two additional\nsites as more headed to the city.\n\nOfficials defended a decision not to call for a mass evacuation because of the\ndangers posed by such a move. A 2005 evacuation ahead of Hurricane Rita turned\ninto a nightmare for many in Texas and Louisiana who found themselves trapped\non clogged roadways and running out of fuel.\n\nArea churches and aid organizations donated clothing, bedding and food for\nthose forced to leave their home. The American Red Cross brought at least\n1,000 volunteers to staff the city's convention center, and provided cots,\nblankets and food for 34,000 across the region, officials said.\n\nHouston called on the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to send cots,\nother supplies and food to help 10,000 people \"as soon as possible,\" Houston\nMayor Sylvester Turner said. The main shelter was initially expected to take\nin 5,000 people, but more than 2,000 arrived late on Monday, and the numbers\nswelled.\n\nAmong them were Maria Davila, 56, her husband, daughter, and two\ngrandchildren, who arrived Monday night after their Houston home was flooded.\n\n\"We left our cars and belongings and starting swimming,\" she said. \"We don't\nknow how long we will be here.\"\n\nDulcie Alexander, 44, was trapped along with several other drivers by heavy\nwater on a highway Saturday night. She and a group of 15 others spent the\nnight in their cars. On Sunday morning they made their way to a fire station,\nand were ferried to the convention center.\n\nCity officials prepared to vote Wednesday to allocate $20 million to storm\nrelief, said city Controller Chris Brown. \"Houston will have enough money to\nhandle this storm,\" he said.\n\nCity officials would not say how many evacuees they expected, or how many the\ncity could hold.\n\n\"We are going to have to take folks. We have no choice,\" said Darian Ward, a\nspokeswoman for Mayor Turner.\n\nLakewood Church, the Houston megachurch that holds televised services in a\nformer basketball arena, announced on Tuesday it would take in up to 300\npeople. The church has been collecting supplies for other centers and is\nproviding on-site health checks.\n\n\"When the city needs us, we try to help,\" said Paul Osteen, the brother of\nLakewood Pastor Joel Osteen and an associate church pastor. Pastor Osteen was\ncriticized on social media for offering prayers, but not opening church doors\nto evacuees.

Nobody's ever seen anything like this,\" Trump\nsaid of Tropical Storm Harvey, as he met state and federal officials for a\nbriefing.\n\nThe president said he was pleased with the response, but it was too soon for a\nvictory lap.\n\n\"We won't say congratulations,\" he said. \"We don't want to do that...We'll\ncongratulate each other when it's all finished.\"\n\nHarvey has drawn comparisons with Hurricane Katrina, which devastated New\nOrleans 12 years ago, killing 1,800 people and causing an estimated $108\nbillion in damage.\n\nFormer President George W. Bush was criticized for his administration's\nhandling of the response to that disaster, causing a heavy toll in public\nsupport, and Trump clearly was aiming to avoid a similar reaction.\n\nDamage from Harvey could cost Houston up to $50 billion in lost economic\nactivity and property damage, the Houston Chronicle said, citing an estimate\nfrom the Greater Houston Partnership and Moody’s Analytics.\n\nRESCUE EFFORTS\n\nThe 13 confirmed deaths included a family of six and Houston Police Sergeant\nSteve Perez, a 34-year force veteran who drowned while attempting to drive to\nwork on Sunday, Police Chief Art Acevedo told reporters.\n\n\"We have work to do,\" the 60-year-old Perez had said to his family, dismissing\ntheir appeals to him to stay home because of the flooding, Acevedo told a news\nconference.\n\nIn Beaumont, northeast of Houston, raging floods swept away a woman clutching\nher baby daughter, who was saved although her mother died, police said.\n\nU.S. Coast Guard air units and boats have rescued more than 4,000 people.\nCitizen volunteers used boats to bring to safety hundreds more.\n\nThe water line is higher than the roofs of some houses, said Commander Jim\nSpitler, commanding officer of Coast Guard Air Station Houston. He urged\npeople stuck on roofs after dark to shine a flashlight or a cell phone light\ninto the night sky, to attract the attention of air crews.\n\nA record 51.88 inches (131.78 cm) of rain has fallen in Texas due to Harvey, a\nrecord for any storm in the continental United States, the National Hurricane\nCenter said on Tuesday.\n\nThat breaks a 1978 record of 48 inches (122 cm) during tropical storm Amelia\nin Medina, Texas, it added.

It says it\nis fighting for the rights of Rohingya.\n\nThe conflict has led to a humanitarian crisis on both sides of the border and\nraised questions about Myanmar's transition under the leadership of Nobel\nlaureate Aung San Suu Kyi after nearly 50 years of strict military rule.\n\nThe generals still control national security policy but nevertheless, Suu Kyi\nhas been widely criticised abroad for not stopping or condemning the violence.\n\nThere is little sympathy for Rohingya in a country where the end of military\nrule has unleashed some old communal animosities and the military campaign in\nRakhine State is generally supported.\n\nEthnic cleansing is not recognised as a separate crime under international law\nbut allegations of ethnic cleansing as part of wider, systematic human rights\nviolations have been heard in international courts.\n\nRights group Amnesty International said on Friday evidence pointed to a \"mass-\nscale scorched-earth campaign\" across the north of Rakhine that was\nunmistakably ethnic cleansing.

{"_id":{"$oid":"59bd81602b6deeaf164b105e"},"text":"By Jason Szep, Peter Eisler and Tim Reid\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - One of the biggest commercial threats to Taser\nInternational’s signature weapon could come from a lawsuit the company won.\n\nAcross the United States, wrongful death lawsuits involving Tasers have\ncreated a body of case law restricting the use of a weapon that reshaped law\nenforcement.\n\nIn the latest key case, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit ruled\nthat police could lose protection from civil lawsuits if they use a Taser on\nnon-violent suspects. The decision prompted cities in the five-state region\nfrom Maryland to South Carolina to adopt new restrictions. It came in a\nlawsuit in which Taser was dismissed as a defendant, stemming from an incident\non April 23, 2011, in Pinehurst, North Carolina.\n\nThere, Jinia Lopez took her 43-year-old brother Ronald Armstrong to a hospital\nafter he tried to poke a hole in his leg with a pencil to “let the air out,”\nLopez said in a deposition. Armstrong, who suffered from schizophrenia, had\nbeen off his bipolar medication for five days.\n\nAt the hospital, he fled to a tuft of grass on a street corner where he ate\ndandelions and extinguished cigarettes with his tongue. Three officers arrived\nin squad cars as hospital security staff jogged over.\n\nLopez and the officers tried to coax Armstrong back to the hospital. Sergeant\nTina Sheppard touted its amenities: good food and television. At 7:18 p.m., an\ninvoluntary commitment order was radioed.\n\nAs officers approached Armstrong, he wrapped himself around the bottom of a\nstop sign. Officer Arthur Gatling drew his Taser.\n\nArmstrong, 5 feet 11 inches and 262 pounds, wouldn’t budge. “I ain’t got to\ngo,” he said.\n\nGatling drive-stunned his upper back; Armstrong tightened his grip. A police\nrecording captures the altercation. “You’re going to get it again,” an officer\nshouts, as Lopez pleads, “Ronald, let it go.” Gatling drive-stunned him four\nmore times, court papers say.\n\nLieutenant Jerry McDonald testified he placed a knee on Armstrong’s back as\nothers struggled to handcuff him and shackle his legs.\n\nLying face-down in the grass, Armstrong didn’t move. Turned over, he wasn’t\nbreathing.\n\n“Ronald, c’mon baby, wake up,” Shepherd says.\n\nLopez screamed. “He’s not breathing. He’s dead.”\n\n“Don’t say that, ma’am,” Shepherd says.\n\n“Breathe, Ronald. Breathe,” Lopez wailed. “Breathe, Ronald. Breathe.”\n\nHe was pronounced dead at the hospital.\n\nA lawsuit filed by Armstrong’s estate in April 2013 accused the three officers\nof using excessive force and alleged Taser manufactured a defective and\ndangerous product.\n\nThe officers testified they restrained Armstrong for his own protection,\nfearing he would flee into traffic.\n\nThe estate’s lawyer, Karonnie Truzy, dismissed Taser from the lawsuit after it\ndocumented its product warnings.\n\nThe officers won. A federal court in North Carolina granted them “qualified\nimmunity,” which provides legal protection unless police violate “clearly\nestablished’’ legal principles.\n\nTruzy appealed. That’s when the case took an unusual turn.\n\nA three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth\nCircuit ruled in January 2016 that the officers used an excessive,\nunconstitutional level of force. But the panel said they couldn’t have known\nit because laws on Tasers were murky.\n\nThe panel upheld the officers’ immunity but put departments “on notice” that\nunless someone poses “an immediate safety risk,” Tasers can’t be used.\n“Erratic behavior and mental illness do not necessarily create a safety risk,”\nthe judges wrote.\n\nThe court’s ruling aligns with human rights groups, including Amnesty\nInternational, who say Tasers should be used only in situations posing a\nthreat of injury or death. In those situations, police typically reach for\ntheir firearm.\n\n“How are officers supposed to go forward based upon this?” asked Michael\nNewman, a lawyer representing Pinehurst.\n\nOf the 442 Taser-related wrongful death lawsuits examined by Reuters, 34\npercent involved allegations the person being shocked, like Armstrong,\nsuffered from mental illness.\n\nAcross the five states covered by the ruling – North Carolina, South Carolina,\nWest Virginia, Maryland and Virginia – police are scaling back use. At least\neight major cities have adopted more restrictive Taser policies, Reuters\nfound.\n\nIn Baltimore, police used Tasers 47 percent fewer times last year than in\n2015, according to records reviewed by Reuters. Deployments fell 65 percent in\nVirginia Beach; 60 percent in Greensboro, North Carolina; 55 percent in\nCharleston, South Carolina; and 52 percent in Huntington, West Virginia.\nNorfolk, Virginia, saw deployments plunge 95 percent.\n\n“Initially there was a belief that there was low risk to life,” said Mark\nNewbold, managing attorney of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department.\n“But as time went on, we had seen an increase between the use of the Taser and\nsomebody dying. And so the risk analysis has changed.”\n\nThough Pinehurst was off the hook in Armstrong’s death, the village’s lawyer,\nDan Hartzog, said Taser, police departments and law enforcement organizations\nurged him to appeal the ruling. The case “really sent reverberations through\nthe police community,” he said.\n\nTaser declined to comment on whether it pressed Pinehurst to appeal.\n\nIn May last year, Pinehurst filed a request to have the U.S. Supreme Court\nhear the case. Briefs in support of Pinehurst were filed by Taser, the\nNational Fraternal Order of Police and the Southern States Police Benevolent\nAssociation, a union representing 30,000 officers.\n\nIn October, the Supreme Court declined to hear the village’s appeal. So while\npolice won the case, the appeals court’s limits on Taser use are now law in\nthe five states.\n\nThe company said the Fourth Circuit ruling could increase the fatal shooting\nrate in the region. “This is of course a tragedy and shows what can happen\nwhen judges believe some of the electrocution mythology and media\nsensationalism surrounding electrical weapons,” spokesman Steve Tuttle said in\nan email.\n\nSome see a different message in the case.\n\n“Armstrong gives us the opportunity to now stand up and say can we walk away\nor can we at the very least step back,” said Ken Wallentine, former chief of\nlaw enforcement for the Utah Attorney General. “One of the messages to police\ndepartments is, ‘Guys, slow down.’ ”\n\n(Editing by Ronnie Greene and Michael Williams)\n\n","dateCreated":{"$date":"2017-08-23T21:15:57.000Z"},"charityOrg":"Amnesty International","headline":"‘Breathe, Ronald, Breathe:’ The court case curbing Taser use","guid":"tag:reuters.com,2017:newsml_KCN1B316F","cause":"human rights","geography":"US"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"59bd81602b6deeaf164b1060"},"text":"By Tim Reid, Peter Eisler, Jason Szep and M.B. Pell\n\nCINCINNATI, Ohio (Reuters) - Officer Richard Haas says he never meant for\nEverette Howard to die. He just wanted to stop him.\n\nA top high-school grad staying on the University of Cincinnati campus for a\ncollege prep program, Howard, 18, had broken no laws that hot August night in\n2011. It was about 3 a.m., and he was agitated after a run-in with\nneighborhood kids who’d tried to rob his friends.\n\nBlocks away, university police officer Haas’s radio crackled with reports of\nan assault. Nearing the scene, he intercepted several people running away and\nordered them to the ground. He unholstered his Taser and panned its red\nsighting beam over them “to get their attention.”\n\nHoward, shirtless, approached from behind with his dorm adviser, Ricky\nPleasant, who’d placed the 911 call. Get down, Haas said. “We’re not the ones\nyou’re looking for,” Pleasant replied.\n\nHoward stepped forward. Pleasant thought the teen intended to kneel; Haas\nthought he intended to fight.\n\nHaas fired his stun gun. One electrified dart hit below Howard’s lower left\nchest, the other near his waist. The 18-year-old collapsed, unconscious, and\nwas pronounced dead at the hospital; the coroner ruled the cause “unknown.”\n\n“I did not in my wildest dreams expect this kid to die,” Haas, a certified\nTaser instructor, told Reuters.\n\nHoward’s family sued Haas in his official capacity as a member of the\nuniversity’s police force, contending he did not heed warnings from the\nweapon’s manufacturer, Taser International Inc, to avoid chest shots because\nthey can pose cardiac risks. The university settled for $2 million; Taser\nfaced no litigation.\n\nAs Tasers have become a common weapon in U.S. policing, so too have legal\ncases like Everette Howard’s. And as the human toll mounts, the litigation\ntoll is increasingly borne by the public.\n\nAt least 442 wrongful death suits have been filed over fatalities that\nfollowed the use of a Taser, almost all since the stun guns began gaining\nwidespread popularity with police in the early 2000s, Reuters found in a\nnationwide review of legal filings. Police departments and the municipalities\nthey represent have faced 435 of these suits. The manufacturer was a defendant\nin 128 of them.\n\nIn all, wrongful death lawsuits were filed in at least 44 percent of the\n1,000-plus incidents Reuters identified in which someone died after being\nstunned with a Taser by police. In nearly 75 percent of the suits, the Taser\nwas one factor alleged in a broader array of force applied, such as punches,\nbaton strikes and pepper spray.\n\nIn more than 60 percent of the resolved cases against municipalities,\ngovernment defendants paid settlements or judgments. While many settlement\namounts are unavailable or remain secret under confidentiality agreements,\nReuters documented at least $172 million in publicly funded payouts to resolve\nthe litigation.\n\nThe claims illustrate the risks and confusion surrounding a weapon embraced by\nabout 90 percent of America’s 18,000 police forces as an alternative to\nfirearms.\n\nYet one party is increasingly absent from the courtroom: Taser International.\n\nFrom 2004 through 2009, the company was named as a defendant in more than 40\npercent of the wrongful death suits filed against local governments, Reuters\nfound. Typically, those suits alleged the company failed to warn adequately of\nthe risks posed by its weapons.\n\nLate in 2009, as evidence of cardiac risks mounted, Taser made a crucial\nchange: It warned police to avoid firing its stun gun’s electrified darts at a\nperson’s chest. Since then, Taser has been a party to just one in five cases\nfiled, and lawyers who frequently handle Taser-related litigation say the\nmanufacturer’s warnings have made it far more difficult to successfully sue\nthe company. So now, in nearly every case, plaintiffs are suing governments,\nnot the manufacturer.\n\nWrongful death lawsuits filed against Taser have slowed to a trickle: four in\n2014, six in 2015, two in 2016 and, according to the company’s latest\ncorporate filings, none so far in 2017.\n\nSuits against municipalities also have declined, Reuters found, from a peak of\nat least 44 in 2009 to at least 31 in 2016. Taser says the Reuters figures\nshow the company’s warnings have reduced liability for police. But the\nmunicipalities defending those cases are finding themselves alone in court\nmore often.\n\n(To see the interactive graphic, The Taser Cases, click here:\nhttp://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/rngs/USA-TASER/0100503D07V/index.html)\n\nBehind these legal battles is a troubling truth: Many officers aren’t aware\nTasers have the potential to kill.\n\nSome police struggle with what they see as contradictory messages from the\ncompany, Reuters found in an examination of thousands of pages of sworn\ntestimony and dozens of interviews: The weapons carry myriad risks, but remain\nfundamentally safe.\n\nOne consequence of that confusion: Some officers still fire their Tasers at\nthe chest. Since the 2009 warning, 44 of the 199 wrongful death lawsuits filed\nagainst police, or more than 20 percent, have included allegations that an\nofficer's Taser shot hit that part of the body, Reuters found.\n\nAfter Everette Howard’s death, Officer Haas, who was cleared of any\nwrongdoing, expressed disbelief that the teen died after the Taser shot. He\nsays he aimed at Howard’s belt line, not the chest. The Taser “is classified\nas a ‘non-lethal’ weapon,” Haas said. He was using a term the company employed\nto describe its signature product until the mid-2000s, when it transitioned to\n“less-lethal.”\n\nMany more changes followed. In addition to cautioning police about chest shots\nand cardiac dangers, the company began warning of the risks of using its\nweapons on people who are old, young, frail, agitated, exhausted or suffering\nfrom an array of health conditions. Some officers and police lawyers say the\nwarnings, now totaling some 4,500 words, have become so broad it’s daunting to\nfollow all the do’s and don’ts.\n\nEd Davis, Boston police chief from 2006 to 2013, said the litany of\nrestrictions helped drive his decision not to issue Tasers. The warnings “made\nthe weapon impractical to use, and it gave a lot of us the impression that we\nweren’t getting the full story,” he said. “I didn’t want to take the risk. The\npotential litigation costs absolutely were a factor.”\n\nTo safeguard itself, product liability specialists say, a manufacturer must\nwarn customers of foreseeable risks, build a defect-free product and make no\nmisrepresentations about its goods. If Taser meets those standards, it can\nfight a wrongful death suit by arguing a fatality was due not to its stun gun,\nbut to police failing to use the device properly.\n\nThe regulatory climate is favorable. The Tasers police buy are not considered\nconsumer or workplace products, so the company’s safety declarations and\nwarnings are not regulated by agencies such as the Consumer Product Safety\nCommission or the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.\n\n“There are not a lot of products that escape all safety agency regulation – it\nreally is unusual,” said David Owen, a law professor specializing in product\nliability at the University of South Carolina School of Law.\n\nTaser, which changed its name to Axon Enterprise Inc this year, says its\nwarnings are designed to protect both the company and its police clients from\nliability.\n\n“Taser training and product safety warnings are strong and unambiguous,” said\nSteve Tuttle, the company’s vice president for communications. No officer\ncertified to carry a Taser “can legitimately claim a lack of awareness or\nknowledge of risks,” he said.\n\n“We do everything we can to ensure that our customers know how to safely\noperate our products,” Tuttle said. “One purpose of our training and our\nwarnings is to provide agencies with information and smart use guidelines to\nhelp them avoid excessive-use-of-force claims.”\n\n(To see the graphic Wrongful Death Lawsuits, click here:\nhttp://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/rngs/USA-TASER/0100503306S/index.html)\n\nTaser’s increasingly restrictive warnings were part of “new risk management\nstrategies” it launched in 2009 “to better protect both the company and its\ncustomers from litigation,” the manufacturer said in a 2015 filing to U.S.\nfinancial regulators. Those changes, it said, were “highly effective.”\n\nMany lawyers who handle wrongful death cases involving stun-gun incidents\ndon’t go after the manufacturer. “I have had five Taser-associated cases. I\nhave never sued Taser,” said Al Gerhardstein, the attorney for Everette\nHoward’s family.\n\nCourts have held that police departments, not Taser, are responsible for\ndeciding how and when Tasers are used in the field. But department policies\nvary widely, Reuters found in a review of the 26 largest departments using\nstun guns. The differences range from how many times a person can be stunned\nto which people shouldn’t be targeted at all, such as the pregnant, the\nelderly and the infirm.\n\nWhen Tasers are handled properly, deaths are rare. Studies have found the\nweapons can reduce injuries to suspects and officers alike by giving police a\nway to control violent suspects without physical confrontations.\n\nThe Taser “has a margin of safety as great as or greater than most\nalternatives” when used appropriately, a 2011 National Institute of Justice\nreport found.\n\nAcross the United States, police forces turn to the stun guns as a vital tool\nin daily policing. Many police chiefs say Tasers’ benefits outweigh their\nrisks.\n\n“Anything that we do that reduces the chance of us having to go to lethal\nforce is useful to us,” said Michael Goldsmith, police chief of Norfolk,\nVirginia. “It’s just a matter of finding the appropriate place for it.”\n\nTHE FINE PRINT\n\nWhen a Taser-related suit is filed, scrutiny typically falls on police\nofficers like Haas, whose use of the Taser in Everette Howard’s death was\ndeemed justified by the county prosecutor. Now retired, Haas struggles to\ngrasp what went wrong.\n\n“I did everything that was supposed to be done,” he said, in his first\ninterview on the case. “It was a tragedy. He had his life in front of him.”\n\nHaas said he closely studied Taser’s safety warnings, even as they grew\nincreasingly complex. His role as a police instructor required not only that\nhe teach fellow officers how to use the weapon, but that he alert them each\ntime Taser’s warnings evolved, in some cases multiple times a year.\n\nIn his 10 years on the University of Cincinnati police force before Howard’s\ndeath, those warnings swelled from a handful of paragraphs tucked into Taser’s\ninstructional materials to a stand-alone, eight-page document.\n\n“Each year, there would be another change,” and the warnings “would become\nmore stringent,” said Haas, who had never fired the stun gun in the field\nbefore that night. “It seemed like it was getting harder and harder to use the\nTaser.”\n\nThe difficulty of tracking Taser’s messages surfaced in a federal lawsuit\nsettled in December.\n\nIn South Boston, Virginia, three officers were accused of ignoring warnings\nwhen they shocked Linwood Lambert roughly 20 times during a fatal 2013\nencounter. Lambert, who was handcuffed, had confessed to using cocaine and was\nso agitated he’d run headlong into glass hospital doors.\n\nIn a 2015 deposition, Corporal Tiffany Bratton, one of the officers involved,\nsaid she was aware of Taser’s warnings when she deployed her stun gun on\nLambert. But she considered them impractical.\n\n“If I read and abided by every single warning,” Bratton testified, “I would\nnot Tase anyone.”\n\nTaser wasn’t a defendant in the suit. The South Boston Police Department\ndeclined to discuss the case, and the town of 8,000 has not disclosed the\nsettlement amount.\n\nA REVOLUTION IN POLICING\n\nThe Taser was developed in 1970 by former NASA scientist Jack Cover, who\nderived the name from a children’s book title: \"Thomas A. Swift's Electric\nRifle.\" For three decades, the device was mostly a niche weapon, unreliable\nand seldom used. Cover’s company, Taser Systems Inc, ultimately went bankrupt.\n\nIn 1993, brothers Rick and Tom Smith acquired the rights and formed what would\nbecome Taser International. By December 1999, the Smiths had developed a more\nrefined, powerful and dependable Taser. They cast it as a seismic\ntransformation in law enforcement.\n\nBy the end of 2003, more than 4,300 police agencies had Tasers – a four-fold\nincrease in two years. Revenue hit $24 million, up from $3 million three years\nearlier. Profits reached $4 million, reversing a $473,247 loss in 2000.\n\nThomas Streicher, then-chief of Cincinnati Police, hailed Tasers as “the only\ninstrument to revolutionize an aspect of policing in the past 35 years.”\n\nYet a new hurdle was emerging: lawsuits.\n\nThe claims against Taser International began as a trickle, going from zero in\n2003 to six in 2004, reaching 19 in 2008.\n\nComplaints of overuse began to proliferate. Some officers resorted to the stun\nguns too quickly in situations that could be de-escalated with words or softer\ntactics, according to a 2011 Justice Department report that referred to the\nproblem as “lazy cop syndrome.”\n\nMunicipalities and their insurers were settling nearly half the Taser-\nassociated suits against them through the mid-2000s, according to court\nrecords. Taser, meanwhile, was succeeding in getting nearly every case against\nit dismissed before trial, arguing that its signature weapon was misused or\nnot the cause of death. The company asserted there was no conclusive\nscientific evidence at the time linking Tasers to cardiac arrest or other\nfatal conditions.\n\nBut Taser’s litigation success was costly: The company’s legal expenses were\napproaching what it paid in salaries and benefits. In 2005 they climbed ten-\nfold, reaching $4 million, regulatory filings show. At least four police\ndepartments suspended Taser use based on liability and safety concerns.\n\nAt the end of 2006, Taser International posted a $4 million loss, its stock\ndown about 75 percent from its 2004 high. The following year, the publicly\ntraded company told investors successful litigation defense would be “a key\nfactor” in its recovery. Taser began assembling medical and legal advisers to\nhelp modify its safety warnings.\n\nBy May 2007, Taser announced it had faced 45 death and injury lawsuits without\na loss. \"Our strategy of fighting this litigation with an aggressive defense\ncontinues to get results,\" it said.\n\nThe streak ended in June 2008 with the case of Robert Heston, who died after\nthree police officers in Salinas, California, shocked him 25 times over 74\nseconds. It was the company’s first loss at trial in a wrongful death case;\nHeston’s family was awarded $6.2 million.\n\nTaser got the amount reduced to $150,000 on appeal, but other troubles\nfollowed. A few months after the Heston verdict, Amnesty International issued\na report documenting more than 300 cases in which people died after being\nshocked with Tasers. The company said its weapons had saved thousands of\nlives.\n\nNEW WARNINGS, CONFUSED COPS\n\nAs Tasers’ safety came under scrutiny, the company changed its language about\nrisks.\n\nTaser regularly described its stun guns as “non-lethal” through the early and\nmid-2000s, adopting a Defense Department term for weapons not meant to kill.\nThe devices posed no serious heart risks, the company said. Taser’s early\ntraining materials advised police to aim for the center of the chest; in 2004,\nthe company urged police trainers to teach officers to stun people as many\ntimes “as necessary” to gain control.\n\nBut in 2005, Taser changed course, warning officers to “avoid prolonged or\ncontinuous exposure(s).” Soon after, it dropped the “non-lethal”\ncharacterization.\n\nAround the same time, researchers began raising questions about Tasers’\nsafety. Peer-reviewed animal studies published in 2006 and later replicated\nfound a Taser discharge to the chest could disrupt the heartbeat, potentially\ncausing death.\n\nIn 2009, on the heels of Taser’s first big court loss in the Heston case, a\nCanadian commission reviewed the case of Robert Dziekański, a Polish immigrant\nwho had died after police stunned him five times with a Taser. Citing the\nrisks of fatalities, the panel concluded that Tasers should be deployed only\n“when the subject is causing” or “will imminently cause bodily harm” – a\nthreshold police departments often use for guns.\n\nThat September, Taser acknowledged its weapons could pose “remote” cardiac\nrisks in otherwise healthy people. Abandoning its longtime recommendation that\npolice target the chest, the company issued revised instructions advising\nofficers to aim at the back or, with front shots, near the beltline.\n\nThe switch angered and confused many police who had relied on Taser’s previous\nsafety assurances, according to legal records and interviews with more than\ntwo dozen current and former law enforcement officials.\n\n“It was perceived that the company was trying to transfer a lot of the\nliability from itself to the municipalities,” said Greg Meyer, a retired Los\nAngeles Police Department captain who now is a litigation consultant on police\nuse of force cases.\n\nIn a conference call with police officials from across the country on October\n23, 2009, Taser CEO Rick Smith said the changes weren’t driven by safety\nconcerns. The impetus, he said, was “risk management and avoiding the\ncontroversy.”\n\n“Are chest hits with the Taser dangerous? And the answer to that is\ndefinitively ‘No,’ ” he said, according to an audio recording of the call.\n\nSmith dismissed the notion that Taser was shifting liability to police. “Will\nTaser help defend officers where there’s chest shots involved? The answer is,\nunequivocally, ‘Yes,’ ” he said.\n\nSmith declined to comment for this story.\n\nOver the next few years, Taser’s warnings grew increasingly expansive. In rare\ncases, a Taser could have a “negative effect” on cardiac function, the company\nacknowledged in 2010.\n\nBy 2013, the warnings included a bold-faced alert that Taser discharges could,\nin rare cases, “capture” the heartbeat, potentially leading to cardiac arrest.\n\nThe instructions advised against repeated or prolonged exposure totaling more\nthan 15 seconds. Users were told to avoid stunning anyone who, among other\nthings, might be impaired by drugs, agitated, exhausted, asthmatic, elderly,\nfrail, running, or at risk of heart problems.\n\nUNAWARE OF RISKS\n\nThe targeting change “hasn’t registered with a lot of officers,” said Matt\nMasters, a 20-year veteran of the Kansas City Police Department. “Taser never\ncame out unequivocally and said, ‘You should not shoot at the chest, and\nhere’s why.’ ”\n\nIn September 2014, Masters’ son Bryce, 17, went into cardiac arrest after a\npolice officer stunned him in the chest with a Taser for at least 20 seconds\nfor refusing to exit a car during a traffic stop. Dragging the teen’s limp\nbody to the curb, the officer dropped him face-first on the pavement before\ncalling for medical help. After emerging from a coma, Bryce had permanent\nbrain injuries, his father said.\n\nTaser has denied in a lawsuit filed by the family that its weapon caused\nBryce’s cardiac arrest.\n\n“Until this happened to my son, I had no idea that Taser had changed the point\nof aim,” said Masters, who has carried a Taser since 2002.\n\nTaser says there is no excuse for officers misunderstanding the risks.\n\n“We get those warnings out there,” Tuttle said. “They are given to the\ndepartments. They are given to the trainers. They are put on (Taser’s) public\nwebsite.”\n\n“What more can we do?”\n\nStill, some officers remain unaware its stun guns can factor in deaths.\n\nOn July 20, 2011 – nearly two years after Taser first warned police to avoid\nchest shots – policeman Michael Forbes in Charlotte, North Carolina, responded\nto a reported altercation between a couple at a light rail station.\n\nHe found La-Reko Williams, 21, and his girlfriend “tussling” on the platform,\n“pushing and pulling” in an argument that began on the train, court records\nshow.\n\nWilliams, a wiry 5-foot-6-inch man, began walking off as Forbes approached;\nthe officer, with nearly four years on the force, told Williams to stop,\ngrabbing at his arm. Williams pushed Forbes’ hand away and turned to argue.\nThe exchange was caught on Forbes’ body recorder.\n\n“I ain’t gotta talk to y’all,” Williams said.\n\n“You’re gonna get detained,” Forbes said. “Do not play with me.”\n\nAs Williams continued arguing, Forbes ordered him to the ground.\n\n“You wanna get Tased?” he asked. Seconds later, his Taser’s darts struck\nWilliams’ chest, knocking him to the ground in pain. Forbes ordered Williams\nto roll onto his stomach, then pulled the Taser’s trigger again, delivering a\nsecond shock.\n\nWilliams died.\n\nThe family sued, saying the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department failed to\ntrain officers properly on Taser’s chest shot warnings. The family’s lawyer,\nKaronnie Truzy, asked Forbes if the department ever told him to avoid\ntargeting the chest.\n\n“I don't believe so,” Forbes testified. “We were trained that the Taser is a\nnon-deadly force option, and that it's reasonably likely not to cause death or\nserious injury.” Forbes declined to comment.\n\nThe police department said it tightened its Taser policy after the incident.\n\nThe city lost at trial, and paid $706,479 to cover the family’s damages and\nlegal fees.\n\n“It’s a deadly weapon,” said Williams’ mother, Temako McCarthy. “Call it for\nwhat it is.”\n\nThe family initially sued Taser, too, but Truzy dropped the company from the\ncase because of Taser’s warnings against chest shots.\n\nTuttle, the manufacturer’s spokesman, said police ultimately make the call\nwhen to deploy the stun guns. “Taser provides instruction on how to operate\nits weapons, but it does not and cannot make agency policy on when, where or\nhow its weapons are to be used,” he wrote.\n\nIn some cases, Taser has assisted plaintiffs lawyers in lawsuits against the\ncompany’s own clients – by providing affidavits to support the argument that\npolice did not abide by its warnings.\n\nThat happened in an Arizona lawsuit alleging Jorge Sanchez, 31, died after a\npolice officer shot him in the chest and discharged the Taser repeatedly\nduring a confrontation in 2012.\n\nSanchez’s mother initially sued Taser, the police and the city of Phoenix.\nTaser was dropped from the case after Michael Brave, the company’s national\nlitigation counsel, provided the plaintiffs with a 10-page affidavit in 2015.\nIt included a 10,914-page attachment listing Taser’s training communications\nwith Phoenix Police, according to documents reviewed by Reuters.\n\n“It’s brilliant when you think about it from a legal standpoint,” said Devon\nJacob, the family lawyer. “Pretty much the only way you could have Taser\nliable at this point is for them to be aware of some sort of danger that they\nhave not warned about.”\n\n(Additional reporting by Grant Smith, Lisa Girion and Ruthy Munoz.

The decision prompted cities in the five-state region\nfrom Maryland to South Carolina to adopt new restrictions. It came in a\nlawsuit in which Taser was dismissed as a defendant, stemming from an incident\non April 23, 2011, in Pinehurst, North Carolina.\n\nThere, Jinia Lopez took her 43-year-old brother Ronald Armstrong to a hospital\nafter he tried to poke a hole in his leg with a pencil to “let the air out,”\nLopez said in a deposition. Armstrong, who suffered from schizophrenia, had\nbeen off his bipolar medication for five days.\n\nAt the hospital, he fled to a tuft of grass on a street corner where he ate\ndandelions and extinguished cigarettes with his tongue. Three officers arrived\nin squad cars as hospital security staff jogged over.\n\nLopez and the officers tried to coax Armstrong back to the hospital. Sergeant\nTina Sheppard touted its amenities: good food and television. At 7:18 p.m., an\ninvoluntary commitment order was radioed.\n\nAs officers approached Armstrong, he wrapped himself around the bottom of a\nstop sign. Officer Arthur Gatling drew his Taser.\n\nArmstrong, 5 feet 11 inches and 262 pounds, wouldn’t budge. “I ain’t got to\ngo,” he said.\n\nGatling drive-stunned his upper back; Armstrong tightened his grip. A police\nrecording captures the altercation. “You’re going to get it again,” an officer\nshouts, as Lopez pleads, “Ronald, let it go.” Gatling drive-stunned him four\nmore times, court papers say.\n\nLieutenant Jerry McDonald testified he placed a knee on Armstrong’s back as\nothers struggled to handcuff him and shackle his legs.\n\nLying face-down in the grass, Armstrong didn’t move. Turned over, he wasn’t\nbreathing.\n\n“Ronald, c’mon baby, wake up,” Shepherd says.\n\nLopez screamed. “He’s not breathing. He’s dead.”\n\n“Don’t say that, ma’am,” Shepherd says.\n\n“Breathe, Ronald. Breathe,” Lopez wailed. “Breathe, Ronald. Breathe.”\n\nHe was pronounced dead at the hospital.\n\nA lawsuit filed by Armstrong’s estate in April 2013 accused the three officers\nof using excessive force and alleged Taser manufactured a defective and\ndangerous product.\n\nThe officers testified they restrained Armstrong for his own protection,\nfearing he would flee into traffic.\n\nThe estate’s lawyer, Karonnie Truzy, dismissed Taser from the lawsuit after it\ndocumented its product warnings.\n\nThe officers won. A federal court in North Carolina granted them “qualified\nimmunity,” which provides legal protection unless police violate “clearly\nestablished’’ legal principles.\n\nTruzy appealed. That’s when the case took an unusual turn.\n\nA three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth\nCircuit ruled in January 2016 that the officers used an excessive,\nunconstitutional level of force. But the panel said they couldn’t have known\nit because laws on Tasers were murky.\n\nThe panel upheld the officers’ immunity but put departments “on notice” that\nunless someone poses “an immediate safety risk,” Tasers can’t be used.\n“Erratic behavior and mental illness do not necessarily create a safety risk,”\nthe judges wrote.\n\nThe court’s ruling aligns with human rights groups, including Amnesty\nInternational, who say Tasers should be used only in situations posing a\nthreat of injury or death. In those situations, police typically reach for\ntheir firearm.\n\n“How are officers supposed to go forward based upon this?” asked Michael\nNewman, a lawyer representing Pinehurst.\n\nOf the 442 Taser-related wrongful death lawsuits examined by Reuters, 34\npercent involved allegations the person being shocked, like Armstrong,\nsuffered from mental illness.\n\nAcross the five states covered by the ruling – North Carolina, South Carolina,\nWest Virginia, Maryland and Virginia – police are scaling back use. At least\neight major cities have adopted more restrictive Taser policies, Reuters\nfound.\n\nIn Baltimore, police used Tasers 47 percent fewer times last year than in\n2015, according to records reviewed by Reuters. Deployments fell 65 percent in\nVirginia Beach; 60 percent in Greensboro, North Carolina; 55 percent in\nCharleston, South Carolina; and 52 percent in Huntington, West Virginia.\nNorfolk, Virginia, saw deployments plunge 95 percent.\n\n“Initially there was a belief that there was low risk to life,” said Mark\nNewbold, managing attorney of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department.\n“But as time went on, we had seen an increase between the use of the Taser and\nsomebody dying. And so the risk analysis has changed.”\n\nThough Pinehurst was off the hook in Armstrong’s death, the village’s lawyer,\nDan Hartzog, said Taser, police departments and law enforcement organizations\nurged him to appeal the ruling. The case “really sent reverberations through\nthe police community,” he said.\n\nTaser declined to comment on whether it pressed Pinehurst to appeal.\n\nIn May last year, Pinehurst filed a request to have the U.S. Supreme Court\nhear the case. Briefs in support of Pinehurst were filed by Taser, the\nNational Fraternal Order of Police and the Southern States Police Benevolent\nAssociation, a union representing 30,000 officers.\n\nIn October, the Supreme Court declined to hear the village’s appeal. So while\npolice won the case, the appeals court’s limits on Taser use are now law in\nthe five states.\n\nThe company said the Fourth Circuit ruling could increase the fatal shooting\nrate in the region. “This is of course a tragedy and shows what can happen\nwhen judges believe some of the electrocution mythology and media\nsensationalism surrounding electrical weapons,” spokesman Steve Tuttle said in\nan email.\n\nSome see a different message in the case.\n\n“Armstrong gives us the opportunity to now stand up and say can we walk away\nor can we at the very least step back,” said Ken Wallentine, former chief of\nlaw enforcement for the Utah Attorney General. “One of the messages to police\ndepartments is, ‘Guys, slow down.’ ”\n\n(Editing by Ronnie Greene and Michael Williams)\n\n","dateCreated":{"$date":"2017-08-23T13:01:00.000Z"},"charityOrg":"Amnesty International","headline":"SPECIAL REPORT-‘Breathe, Ronald, Breathe:’ The court case curbing Taser use","guid":"tag:reuters.com,2017:newsml_L2N1L70TH","cause":"human rights","geography":"US"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"59bd81602b6deeaf164b1064"},"text":"(This is the second story in a series about Tasers, \"Shock Tactics\")\n\nBy Tim Reid, Peter Eisler, Jason Szep and M.B. Pell\n\nCINCINNATI, Ohio, Aug 23 (Reuters) - Officer Richard Haas says he never meant\nfor Everette Howard to die. He just wanted to stop him.\n\nA top high-school grad staying on the University of Cincinnati campus for a\ncollege prep program, Howard, 18, had broken no laws that hot August night in\n2011. It was about 3 a.m., and he was agitated after a run-in with\nneighborhood kids who’d tried to rob his friends.\n\nBlocks away, university police officer Haas’s radio crackled with reports of\nan assault. Nearing the scene, he intercepted several people running away and\nordered them to the ground. He unholstered his Taser and panned its red\nsighting beam over them “to get their attention.”\n\nHoward, shirtless, approached from behind with his dorm adviser, Ricky\nPleasant, who’d placed the 911 call. Get down, Haas said. “We’re not the ones\nyou’re looking for,” Pleasant replied.\n\nHoward stepped forward. Pleasant thought the teen intended to kneel; Haas\nthought he intended to fight.\n\nHaas fired his stun gun. One electrified dart hit below Howard’s lower left\nchest, the other near his waist. The 18-year-old collapsed, unconscious, and\nwas pronounced dead at the hospital; the coroner ruled the cause “unknown.”\n\n“I did not in my wildest dreams expect this kid to die,” Haas, a certified\nTaser instructor, told Reuters.\n\nHoward’s family sued Haas in his official capacity as a member of the\nuniversity’s police force, contending he did not heed warnings from the\nweapon’s manufacturer, Taser International Inc, to avoid chest shots because\nthey can pose cardiac risks. The university settled for $2 million; Taser\nfaced no litigation.\n\nAs Tasers have become a common weapon in U.S. policing, so too have legal\ncases like Everette Howard’s. And as the human toll mounts, the litigation\ntoll is increasingly borne by the public.\n\nAt least 442 wrongful death suits have been filed over fatalities that\nfollowed the use of a Taser, almost all since the stun guns began gaining\nwidespread popularity with police in the early 2000s, Reuters found in a\nnationwide review of legal filings. Police departments and the municipalities\nthey represent have faced 435 of these suits. The manufacturer was a defendant\nin 128 of them.\n\nIn all, wrongful death lawsuits were filed in at least 44 percent of the\n1,000-plus incidents Reuters identified in which someone died after being\nstunned with a Taser by police. In nearly 75 percent of the suits, the Taser\nwas one factor alleged in a broader array of force applied, such as punches,\nbaton strikes and pepper spray.\n\nIn more than 60 percent of the resolved cases against municipalities,\ngovernment defendants paid settlements or judgments. While many settlement\namounts are unavailable or remain secret under confidentiality agreements,\nReuters documented at least $172 million in publicly funded payouts to resolve\nthe litigation.\n\nThe claims illustrate the risks and confusion surrounding a weapon embraced by\nabout 90 percent of America’s 18,000 police forces as an alternative to\nfirearms.\n\nYet one party is increasingly absent from the courtroom: Taser International.\n\nFrom 2004 through 2009, the company was named as a defendant in more than 40\npercent of the wrongful death suits filed against local governments, Reuters\nfound. Typically, those suits alleged the company failed to warn adequately of\nthe risks posed by its weapons.\n\nLate in 2009, as evidence of cardiac risks mounted, Taser made a crucial\nchange: It warned police to avoid firing its stun gun’s electrified darts at a\nperson’s chest. Since then, Taser has been a party to just one in five cases\nfiled, and lawyers who frequently handle Taser-related litigation say the\nmanufacturer’s warnings have made it far more difficult to successfully sue\nthe company. So now, in nearly every case, plaintiffs are suing governments,\nnot the manufacturer.\n\nWrongful death lawsuits filed against Taser have slowed to a trickle: four in\n2014, six in 2015, two in 2016 and, according to the company’s latest\ncorporate filings, none so far in 2017.\n\nSuits against municipalities also have declined, Reuters found, from a peak of\nat least 44 in 2009 to at least 31 in 2016\\. Taser says the Reuters figures\nshow the company’s warnings have reduced liability for police. But the\nmunicipalities defending those cases are finding themselves alone in court\nmore often.\n\n(To see the interactive graphic, The Taser Cases, click here:\nhttp://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/rngs/USA-TASER/0100503D07V/index.html)\n\nBehind these legal battles is a troubling truth: Many officers aren’t aware\nTasers have the potential to kill.\n\nSome police struggle with what they see as contradictory messages from the\ncompany, Reuters found in an examination of thousands of pages of sworn\ntestimony and dozens of interviews: The weapons carry myriad risks, but remain\nfundamentally safe.\n\nOne consequence of that confusion: Some officers still fire their Tasers at\nthe chest. Since the 2009 warning, 44 of the 199 wrongful death lawsuits filed\nagainst police, or more than 20 percent, have included allegations that an\nofficer's Taser shot hit that part of the body, Reuters found.\n\nAfter Everette Howard’s death, Officer Haas, who was cleared of any\nwrongdoing, expressed disbelief that the teen died after the Taser shot. He\nsays he aimed at Howard’s belt line, not the chest. The Taser “is classified\nas a ‘non-lethal’ weapon,” Haas said. He was using a term the company employed\nto describe its signature product until the mid-2000s, when it transitioned to\n“less-lethal.”\n\nMany more changes followed. In addition to cautioning police about chest shots\nand cardiac dangers, the company began warning of the risks of using its\nweapons on people who are old, young, frail, agitated, exhausted or suffering\nfrom an array of health conditions. Some officers and police lawyers say the\nwarnings, now totaling some 4,500 words, have become so broad it’s daunting to\nfollow all the do’s and don’ts.\n\nEd Davis, Boston police chief from 2006 to 2013, said the litany of\nrestrictions helped drive his decision not to issue Tasers. The warnings “made\nthe weapon impractical to use, and it gave a lot of us the impression that we\nweren’t getting the full story,” he said. “I didn’t want to take the risk. The\npotential litigation costs absolutely were a factor.”\n\nTo safeguard itself, product liability specialists say, a manufacturer must\nwarn customers of foreseeable risks, build a defect-free product and make no\nmisrepresentations about its goods. If Taser meets those standards, it can\nfight a wrongful death suit by arguing a fatality was due not to its stun gun,\nbut to police failing to use the device properly.\n\nThe regulatory climate is favorable. The Tasers police buy are not considered\nconsumer or workplace products, so the company’s safety declarations and\nwarnings are not regulated by agencies such as the Consumer Product Safety\nCommission or the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.\n\n“There are not a lot of products that escape all safety agency regulation – it\nreally is unusual,” said David Owen, a law professor specializing in product\nliability at the University of South Carolina School of Law.\n\nTaser, which changed its name to Axon Enterprise Inc this year, says its\nwarnings are designed to protect both the company and its police clients from\nliability.\n\n“Taser training and product safety warnings are strong and unambiguous,” said\nSteve Tuttle, the company’s vice president for communications. No officer\ncertified to carry a Taser “can legitimately claim a lack of awareness or\nknowledge of risks,” he said.\n\n“We do everything we can to ensure that our customers know how to safely\noperate our products,” Tuttle said. “One purpose of our training and our\nwarnings is to provide agencies with information and smart use guidelines to\nhelp them avoid excessive-use-of-force claims.”\n\n(To see the graphic Wrongful Death Lawsuits, click here:\nhttp://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/rngs/USA-TASER/0100503306S/index.html)\n\nTaser’s increasingly restrictive warnings were part of “new risk management\nstrategies” it launched in 2009 “to better protect both the company and its\ncustomers from litigation,” the manufacturer said in a 2015 filing to U.S.\nfinancial regulators. Those changes, it said, were “highly effective.”\n\nMany lawyers who handle wrongful death cases involving stun-gun incidents\ndon’t go after the manufacturer. “I have had five Taser-associated cases. I\nhave never sued Taser,” said Al Gerhardstein, the attorney for Everette\nHoward’s family.\n\nCourts have held that police departments, not Taser, are responsible for\ndeciding how and when Tasers are used in the field. But department policies\nvary widely, Reuters found in a review of the 26 largest departments using\nstun guns. The differences range from how many times a person can be stunned\nto which people shouldn’t be targeted at all, such as the pregnant, the\nelderly and the infirm.\n\nWhen Tasers are handled properly, deaths are rare. Studies have found the\nweapons can reduce injuries to suspects and officers alike by giving police a\nway to control violent suspects without physical confrontations.\n\nThe Taser “has a margin of safety as great as or greater than most\nalternatives” when used appropriately, a 2011 National Institute of Justice\nreport found.\n\nAcross the United States, police forces turn to the stun guns as a vital tool\nin daily policing. Many police chiefs say Tasers’ benefits outweigh their\nrisks.\n\n“Anything that we do that reduces the chance of us having to go to lethal\nforce is useful to us,” said Michael Goldsmith, police chief of Norfolk,\nVirginia. “It’s just a matter of finding the appropriate place for it.”\n\nTHE FINE PRINT\n\nWhen a Taser-related suit is filed, scrutiny typically falls on police\nofficers like Haas, whose use of the Taser in Everette Howard’s death was\ndeemed justified by the county prosecutor. Now retired, Haas struggles to\ngrasp what went wrong.\n\n“I did everything that was supposed to be done,” he said, in his first\ninterview on the case. “It was a tragedy. He had his life in front of him.”\n\nHaas said he closely studied Taser’s safety warnings, even as they grew\nincreasingly complex. His role as a police instructor required not only that\nhe teach fellow officers how to use the weapon, but that he alert them each\ntime Taser’s warnings evolved, in some cases multiple times a year.\n\nIn his 10 years on the University of Cincinnati police force before Howard’s\ndeath, those warnings swelled from a handful of paragraphs tucked into Taser’s\ninstructional materials to a stand-alone, eight-page document.\n\n“Each year, there would be another change,” and the warnings “would become\nmore stringent,” said Haas, who had never fired the stun gun in the field\nbefore that night. “It seemed like it was getting harder and harder to use the\nTaser.”\n\nThe difficulty of tracking Taser’s messages surfaced in a federal lawsuit\nsettled in December.\n\nIn South Boston, Virginia, three officers were accused of ignoring warnings\nwhen they shocked Linwood Lambert roughly 20 times during a fatal 2013\nencounter. Lambert, who was handcuffed, had confessed to using cocaine and was\nso agitated he’d run headlong into glass hospital doors.\n\nIn a 2015 deposition, Corporal Tiffany Bratton, one of the officers involved,\nsaid she was aware of Taser’s warnings when she deployed her stun gun on\nLambert. But she considered them impractical.\n\n“If I read and abided by every single warning,” Bratton testified, “I would\nnot Tase anyone.”\n\nTaser wasn’t a defendant in the suit. The South Boston Police Department\ndeclined to discuss the case, and the town of 8,000 has not disclosed the\nsettlement amount.\n\nA REVOLUTION IN POLICING\n\nThe Taser was developed in 1970 by former NASA scientist Jack Cover, who\nderived the name from a children’s book title: \"Thomas A. Swift's Electric\nRifle.\" For three decades, the device was mostly a niche weapon, unreliable\nand seldom used. Cover’s company, Taser Systems Inc, ultimately went bankrupt.\n\nIn 1993, brothers Rick and Tom Smith acquired the rights and formed what would\nbecome Taser International. By December 1999, the Smiths had developed a more\nrefined, powerful and dependable Taser. They cast it as a seismic\ntransformation in law enforcement.\n\nBy the end of 2003, more than 4,300 police agencies had Tasers – a four-fold\nincrease in two years. Revenue hit $24 million, up from $3 million three years\nearlier. Profits reached $4 million, reversing a $473,247 loss in 2000.\n\nThomas Streicher, then-chief of Cincinnati Police, hailed Tasers as “the only\ninstrument to revolutionize an aspect of policing in the past 35 years.”\n\nYet a new hurdle was emerging: lawsuits.\n\nThe claims against Taser International began as a trickle, going from zero in\n2003 to six in 2004, reaching 19 in 2008.\n\nComplaints of overuse began to proliferate. Some officers resorted to the stun\nguns too quickly in situations that could be de-escalated with words or softer\ntactics, according to a 2011 Justice Department report that referred to the\nproblem as “lazy cop syndrome.”\n\nMunicipalities and their insurers were settling nearly half the Taser-\nassociated suits against them through the mid-2000s, according to court\nrecords. Taser, meanwhile, was succeeding in getting nearly every case against\nit dismissed before trial, arguing that its signature weapon was misused or\nnot the cause of death. The company asserted there was no conclusive\nscientific evidence at the time linking Tasers to cardiac arrest or other\nfatal conditions.\n\nBut Taser’s litigation success was costly: The company’s legal expenses were\napproaching what it paid in salaries and benefits. In 2005 they climbed ten-\nfold, reaching $4 million, regulatory filings show. At least four police\ndepartments suspended Taser use based on liability and safety concerns.\n\nAt the end of 2006, Taser International posted a $4 million loss, its stock\ndown about 75 percent from its 2004 high. The following year, the publicly\ntraded company told investors successful litigation defense would be “a key\nfactor” in its recovery. Taser began assembling medical and legal advisers to\nhelp modify its safety warnings.\n\nBy May 2007, Taser announced it had faced 45 death and injury lawsuits without\na loss. \"Our strategy of fighting this litigation with an aggressive defense\ncontinues to get results,\" it said.\n\nThe streak ended in June 2008 with the case of Robert Heston, who died after\nthree police officers in Salinas, California, shocked him 25 times over 74\nseconds. It was the company’s first loss at trial in a wrongful death case;\nHeston’s family was awarded $6.2 million.\n\nTaser got the amount reduced to $150,000 on appeal, but other troubles\nfollowed. A few months after the Heston verdict, Amnesty International issued\na report documenting more than 300 cases in which people died after being\nshocked with Tasers. The company said its weapons had saved thousands of\nlives.\n\nNEW WARNINGS, CONFUSED COPS\n\nAs Tasers’ safety came under scrutiny, the company changed its language about\nrisks.\n\nTaser regularly described its stun guns as “non-lethal” through the early and\nmid-2000s, adopting a Defense Department term for weapons not meant to kill.\nThe devices posed no serious heart risks, the company said. Taser’s early\ntraining materials advised police to aim for the center of the chest; in 2004,\nthe company urged police trainers to teach officers to stun people as many\ntimes “as necessary” to gain control.\n\nBut in 2005, Taser changed course, warning officers to “avoid prolonged or\ncontinuous exposure(s).” Soon after, it dropped the “non-lethal”\ncharacterization.\n\nAround the same time, researchers began raising questions about Tasers’\nsafety. Peer-reviewed animal studies published in 2006 and later replicated\nfound a Taser discharge to the chest could disrupt the heartbeat, potentially\ncausing death.\n\nIn 2009, on the heels of Taser’s first big court loss in the Heston case, a\nCanadian commission reviewed the case of Robert Dziekański, a Polish immigrant\nwho had died after police stunned him five times with a Taser. Citing the\nrisks of fatalities, the panel concluded that Tasers should be deployed only\n“when the subject is causing” or “will imminently cause bodily harm” – a\nthreshold police departments often use for guns.\n\nThat September, Taser acknowledged its weapons could pose “remote” cardiac\nrisks in otherwise healthy people. Abandoning its longtime recommendation that\npolice target the chest, the company issued revised instructions advising\nofficers to aim at the back or, with front shots, near the beltline.\n\nThe switch angered and confused many police who had relied on Taser’s previous\nsafety assurances, according to legal records and interviews with more than\ntwo dozen current and former law enforcement officials.\n\n“It was perceived that the company was trying to transfer a lot of the\nliability from itself to the municipalities,” said Greg Meyer, a retired Los\nAngeles Police Department captain who now is a litigation consultant on police\nuse of force cases.\n\nIn a conference call with police officials from across the country on October\n23, 2009, Taser CEO Rick Smith said the changes weren’t driven by safety\nconcerns. The impetus, he said, was “risk management and avoiding the\ncontroversy.”\n\n“Are chest hits with the Taser dangerous? And the answer to that is\ndefinitively ‘No,’ ” he said, according to an audio recording of the call.\n\nSmith dismissed the notion that Taser was shifting liability to police. “Will\nTaser help defend officers where there’s chest shots involved? The answer is,\nunequivocally, ‘Yes,’ ” he said.\n\nSmith declined to comment for this story.\n\nOver the next few years, Taser’s warnings grew increasingly expansive. In rare\ncases, a Taser could have a “negative effect” on cardiac function, the company\nacknowledged in 2010.\n\nBy 2013, the warnings included a bold-faced alert that Taser discharges could,\nin rare cases, “capture” the heartbeat, potentially leading to cardiac arrest.\n\nThe instructions advised against repeated or prolonged exposure totaling more\nthan 15 seconds. Users were told to avoid stunning anyone who, among other\nthings, might be impaired by drugs, agitated, exhausted, asthmatic, elderly,\nfrail, running, or at risk of heart problems.\n\nUNAWARE OF RISKS\n\nThe targeting change “hasn’t registered with a lot of officers,” said Matt\nMasters, a 20-year veteran of the Kansas City Police Department. “Taser never\ncame out unequivocally and said, ‘You should not shoot at the chest, and\nhere’s why.’ ”\n\nIn September 2014, Masters’ son Bryce, 17, went into cardiac arrest after a\npolice officer stunned him in the chest with a Taser for at least 20 seconds\nfor refusing to exit a car during a traffic stop. Dragging the teen’s limp\nbody to the curb, the officer dropped him face-first on the pavement before\ncalling for medical help. After emerging from a coma, Bryce had permanent\nbrain injuries, his father said.\n\nTaser has denied in a lawsuit filed by the family that its weapon caused\nBryce’s cardiac arrest.\n\n“Until this happened to my son, I had no idea that Taser had changed the point\nof aim,” said Masters, who has carried a Taser since 2002.\n\nTaser says there is no excuse for officers misunderstanding the risks.\n\n“We get those warnings out there,” Tuttle said. “They are given to the\ndepartments. They are given to the trainers. They are put on (Taser’s) public\nwebsite.”\n\n“What more can we do?”\n\nStill, some officers remain unaware its stun guns can factor in deaths.\n\nOn July 20, 2011 – nearly two years after Taser first warned police to avoid\nchest shots – policeman Michael Forbes in Charlotte, North Carolina, responded\nto a reported altercation between a couple at a light rail station.\n\nHe found La-Reko Williams, 21, and his girlfriend “tussling” on the platform,\n“pushing and pulling” in an argument that began on the train, court records\nshow.\n\nWilliams, a wiry 5-foot-6-inch man, began walking off as Forbes approached;\nthe officer, with nearly four years on the force, told Williams to stop,\ngrabbing at his arm. Williams pushed Forbes’ hand away and turned to argue.\nThe exchange was caught on Forbes’ body recorder.\n\n“I ain’t gotta talk to y’all,” Williams said.\n\n“You’re gonna get detained,” Forbes said. “Do not play with me.”\n\nAs Williams continued arguing, Forbes ordered him to the ground.\n\n“You wanna get Tased?” he asked. Seconds later, his Taser’s darts struck\nWilliams’ chest, knocking him to the ground in pain. Forbes ordered Williams\nto roll onto his stomach, then pulled the Taser’s trigger again, delivering a\nsecond shock.\n\nWilliams died.\n\nThe family sued, saying the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department failed to\ntrain officers properly on Taser’s chest shot warnings. The family’s lawyer,\nKaronnie Truzy, asked Forbes if the department ever told him to avoid\ntargeting the chest.\n\n“I don't believe so,” Forbes testified. “We were trained that the Taser is a\nnon-deadly force option, and that it's reasonably likely not to cause death or\nserious injury.” Forbes declined to comment.\n\nThe police department said it tightened its Taser policy after the incident.\n\nThe city lost at trial, and paid $706,479 to cover the family’s damages and\nlegal fees.\n\n“It’s a deadly weapon,” said Williams’ mother, Temako McCarthy. “Call it for\nwhat it is.”\n\nThe family initially sued Taser, too, but Truzy dropped the company from the\ncase because of Taser’s warnings against chest shots.\n\nTuttle, the manufacturer’s spokesman, said police ultimately make the call\nwhen to deploy the stun guns. “Taser provides instruction on how to operate\nits weapons, but it does not and cannot make agency policy on when, where or\nhow its weapons are to be used,” he wrote.\n\nIn some cases, Taser has assisted plaintiffs lawyers in lawsuits against the\ncompany’s own clients – by providing affidavits to support the argument that\npolice did not abide by its warnings.\n\nThat happened in an Arizona lawsuit alleging Jorge Sanchez, 31, died after a\npolice officer shot him in the chest and discharged the Taser repeatedly\nduring a confrontation in 2012.\n\nSanchez’s mother initially sued Taser, the police and the city of Phoenix.\nTaser was dropped from the case after Michael Brave, the company’s national\nlitigation counsel, provided the plaintiffs with a 10-page affidavit in 2015.\nIt included a 10,914-page attachment listing Taser’s training communications\nwith Phoenix Police, according to documents reviewed by Reuters.\n\n“It’s brilliant when you think about it from a legal standpoint,” said Devon\nJacob, the family lawyer. “Pretty much the only way you could have Taser\nliable at this point is for them to be aware of some sort of danger that they\nhave not warned about.”\n\n(Additional reporting by Grant Smith, Lisa Girion and Ruthy Munoz.

{"_id":{"$oid":"59bd81602b6deeaf164b1066"},"text":"By Peter Eisler, Grant Smith and Jason Szep\n\nAug 22 (Reuters) - In a first-of-its-kind review of court documents, police\nreports, other public records and news accounts, Reuters compiled the most\ncomprehensive public accounting to date of deaths and litigation that followed\npolice use of Tasers.\n\nIn all, reporters documented 1,005 people who have died in the United States\nfollowing encounters with police in which Tasers were used either on their own\nor, more often, as part of a larger mosaic of force. In at least 153 of those\ncases, Reuters found, coroners or medical examiners cited the Taser as a cause\nor contributing factor in the death.\n\nAmong the 1,000-plus fatalities, Reuters found that wrongful death lawsuits\nwere filed in at least 442 of the incidents. Nearly all the suits – 435 – were\nfiled against police and the municipalities that employ them. Taser\nInternational, the manufacturer, was named as a defendant in 128 cases. There\nwere three lawsuits, from 1983 to 1987, against Taser Industries Inc, a\nbusiness Taser International acquired in 2003. The company recently changed\nits name to Axon Enterprise Inc.\n\nReuters conducted hundreds of interviews with current and former police\nofficials, lawyers involved in lawsuits involving Tasers, academics and other\nindependent experts, relatives of people who died and Taser International.\n\nHere are the sources of information and the methodologies behind the project’s\nkey findings:\n\nDeaths following Taser shocks:\n\nTo identify these cases, Reuters examined thousands of court records, police\nreports and news stories from 1983, the earliest mention of a fatality\nidentified in a police encounter where a Taser was used, through July 31,\n2017. Legal records were searched using Westlaw, a database of legal filings\nowned by Thomson Reuters, as well as Lexis and Pacer, two other databases of\nlegal documents. Reuters also researched news accounts nationwide.\n\nThe news agency reviewed reports by other organizations that tracked deaths in\nincidents where Tasers were used, including the human rights group Amnesty\nInternational, and advocacy websites Truth Not Tasers and Fatal Encounters.\nReuters used stricter criteria than those organizations to decide which cases\nto count, so our tally does not include more than three dozen deaths those\norganizations identified. Nevertheless, Reuters’ listing of 1,005 deaths is 44\npercent larger than the 700 reported by Amnesty at the end of 2016.\n\nAmong the cases Reuters opted not to include were those in which a person was\nshot with a firearm after being stunned by a Taser. The only exceptions were\nsix cases in which the Taser use was cited in a wrongful death lawsuit or an\nautopsy specifically ruled out the gunshot as the primary cause of death.\nReuters also counted only those deaths in which it could identify the victim\nand confirm through court documents, police reports, other public records or\ncredible media accounts that a Taser was used. If Reuters was unable to\nconfirm Taser use, the incident wasn’t counted. For example, some lists of\nfatalities involving Tasers include Mark Lee, who died in a 2006 encounter\nwith police in Rochester, New York. News reports said police disputed the\nfamily’s assertion that a Taser was used. Reuters omitted the case after\ncontacting the family’s lawyer, who said the Lees were ultimately unable to\nprove “definitively” a Taser was used.\n\nReuters included 17 cases in which people died from choking on bags of drugs\nwhile being stunned. The news agency surveyed a number of pathologists on\nwhether a Taser shock would increase the likelihood of choking under those\ncircumstances. They offered no clear consensus but most suggested it was\npossible.\n\nTaser said the only deaths that can be attributed to its stun guns involve 24\ncases in which the person died from secondary injuries, such as falls or fires\ncaused by the Taser.\n\nTaser International also tracks deaths in police incidents where its weapons\nwere used and catalogs that information in a “database of in-custody deaths\nproximal to TASER use,” according to court testimony from company officials.\nThe company declined to share the data with Reuters.\n\nSeventeen of the deaths on the Reuters list occurred before Taser\nInternational acquired the technology from its inventor in 1993 and began\nmarketing its first version of the weapons.\n\nAutopsy findings:\n\nTaser International has long argued that its weapons are almost never to blame\nwhen someone dies after being stunned. Reuters sought autopsy results and\ncause-of-death rulings for all the 1,000-plus deaths. Many states restrict\naccess to autopsy records and do not release them publicly.\n\nBut Reuters was able to collect official cause-of-death rulings for more than\n70 percent of the deaths it identified – 712 cases. Tasers were listed as a\ncause of death or a contributing factor or condition in 153 of those cases.\nMost of the other autopsies cited a combination of heart and medical\nconditions, drug use and various forms of trauma.\n\nMany of the autopsies reviewed by Reuters listed the cause of death as \"multi-\nfactorial.\" The autopsies that cited a Taser shock often included it as one of\nseveral components of their ruling.\n\nTo collect the autopsies, Reuters filed public records requests in dozens of\nstates and scores of counties. In 278 cases, Reuters obtained full autopsies.\nIn 348 others, medical examiners, coroners or other local officials provided\nthe cause-of-death findings, often with contributing factors or conditions, in\nwriting or by reciting the information over the phone.\n\nIn 86 cases, Reuters obtained cause of death information through other\nofficial records, such as reports from state investigations or court\ndocuments.\n\nWrongful death lawsuits:\n\nReuters set out to identify all wrongful death suits filed in cases where\nsomeone died after being stunned with a Taser during a police encounter. The\nprocess involved constructing a series of queries using different parameters\nto search Westlaw, Lexis and Pacer. Reuters also combed through state court\nfilings in dozens of states to find lawsuits. Those searches yielded several\nthousand suits in which a stun gun was mentioned.\n\nReporters then reviewed all the search results and identified 442 cases in\nwhich Tasers factored into a wrongful death claim, sifting out injury suits\nand the vast majority of suits in which the subject was shot with a firearm.\nIn 120 of the 442 cases, or 27 percent, the Taser was the only force alleged\nin the claim; in the remaining 322 cases, the stun guns were alleged to have\nbeen part of a broader array of police force.\n\nMost of those cases were filed in federal court. Because not all state courts\nare included in Westlaw and other legal databases, the 442 figure likely omits\nsome state cases.\n\nSettlements and awards:\n\nMore than three-fifths of the 366 concluded lawsuits against governments, or\n232, resulted in judgments or settlements for the plaintiffs: 220 settlements\nand 12 judgments. Reuters was able to determine the payouts in 193 cases,\ntotaling $172 million paid by cities and their insurers. That dollar figure\ndoes not include three dozen cases in which settlements remained confidential\nor were unavailable.\n\nThe settlement and judgment totals were obtained by filing public records\nrequests with dozens of municipalities. In some cases, government agencies\ndeclined or did not respond to requests for data. In some of those instances,\nReuters was able to confirm settlement amounts through court records, lawyers\nor media reports.\n\nBecause Reuters was not able to identify settlement amounts in dozens of cases\nwhere terms weren’t disclosed, the actual total of payouts by local\ngovernments and their insurers is certainly higher than $172 million.\n\nTaser declined to share detailed information on which cases it has settled and\nhow much it has paid to satisfy those settlements.\n\n(Editing by Ronnie Greene and Michael Williams)\n\n","dateCreated":{"$date":"2017-08-22T13:52:39.000Z"},"charityOrg":"Amnesty International","headline":"SPECIAL REPORT -How Reuters tracked fatalities and Taser incidents","guid":"tag:reuters.com,2017:newsml_L2N1L41KL","cause":"human rights","geography":"US"}
